mr. pendell: it please the court. thank you, your honor, may when i was a boy, like most children, i 01:03 01:03 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 3951 thought justice was easy. i thought if you did the right thing, followed the rules, good would triumph over evil. of course, when i grew up, i found that was not always the case. that is not how the world works and that is why i became a trial lawyer. not every day, but some days, i get to participate in a justice system and sometimes, sometimes i get to help make justice happen. unfortunately, now, justice is not always easy. in fact, it is always hard, always hard, because justice presents a threat to power. in order to make justice come into being, you have to fight power. but each time you strike out against injustice, you send forth tiny ripples and each of those tiny ripples turns into a current that can sweep away even the most gross and flagrant injustice. and that is why your job here in this courtroom is so important. today, as trudy marchese's jury, you and nobody else has the opportunity to do justice for sal marchese, to make sure that the tragic story of his life has a just ending. this courtroom almost two weeks ago, my friend, mr. oliver, you heard him talk to you about how when you came into 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:04 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:05 01:06 01:06 3952 this case was going to be about three things, opportunity, choices, responsibility. and you saw and you heard a lot of evidence about the choices that were made, the opportunities that were squandered, the evasion of responsibility, the failure of philip morris and reynolds to take responsibility for their actions, for designing cigarettes that are addictive or pushing those cigarettes on young people like sal marchese, and denying, disputing and concealing material facts, important facts, about the dangers of cigarettes for more than four decades. to be clear, these are choices that philip morris and reynolds made that brought each and every one of you to this moment in this courtroom today. after everybody rests, you hear all the lawyers speak, you guys are going to have to go back into the jury room and you are going to have to make a choice and the choice that you are going to make is going to write the last chapter of sal marchese's life. have to remember how we got to this moment. to make the right choice, you it started in the 1940s when a young sal marchese was just 13 or 14 years old and this was a time without the internet, without cell phones, 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:06 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 3953 without 24-hour news cycles. people trusted corporations. described it to me as a 9-to-5 world those days. this was a time when trudy marchese aptly everybody in america was smoking. you you heard okay. she lived she told you that people smoked in her heard dr. proctor tell you about it. testimony from trudy marchese about it. it. doctor's office, people smoked in the school cafeteria, people smoked while pregnant. you saw video from the head of the american medical association in 1954, elmer hess, he told people he did not believe that smoking was harming him or anybody else. the american medical association. that is the head of now, if we got into a time machine, and i hope we were able to sort of metaphorically get into a time machine and take you back to those days over the course of this trial, to those days when young sal marchese had started smoking and grew into a man in the 50s and 60s, if we could go back to those days, people would be smoking right here in this courtroom, right at this moment. this was before warnings, before widespread public knowledge about the dangers of cigarette smoking. now, if you remember, dr. proctor showed 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:07 01:08 01:08 3954 tobacco consumption really you this board that he wrote on and this board shows the rise of tobacco consumption in the united states. started -- it started in the 20th century and the peak of consumption occurred in the 60s until the 80s, continued to rise. and it started to decline in the 1990s around the time that sal marchese was diagnosed with copd. how did it happen? how did this country it was no reynolds and philip morris how did that happen? it was part of the defendants' plan, go from a nation where cigarettes were a rarity to a nation where it was sewn into the fabric of our culture? accident. you saw the evidence. did not just make cigarettes, they not only created the supply, but they created the demand. they did it by focusing on the pleasures of the smoking while ignoring, denying and disputing the disease-causing components of cigarettes. they put cigarettes in the hands of beautiful people, popular people. people that mr. marchese and millions of others just like him wanted to be like. cigarette manufacturers, including reynolds and philip morris, they were the biggest 01:08 01:09 01:09 01:09 01:09 01:09 01:09 01:09 01:09 01:09 01:10 01:10 01:10 01:10 you saw this during the trial and it talks advertisers of their day and that is why sal marchese and his family and millions of other families in this country all started smoking. you heard dr. proctor tell you that for boys born at the same time as mr. marchese, 70 percent of them, seventy percent, were smokers by the time they were 20 years old. 1693. about the phenomenal growth of cigarette consumption in this country. interlinked with the development of nationwide and unprecedented advertising campaigns and promotion of this product. advertising. went to number one in new york city in 30 days because of an advertisement. it is indubitably you saw lots of videos about you saw the marlboro story, marlboro this is an exhibit showing different advertisements that you got to see and dr. proctor, who was our tobacco industry historian, he came here and he talked to you and he showed you how r.j. reynolds and philip morris portrayed smoking in the 1920s all the way through the 1990s in this country, they portrayed it as glamourous, as grownup, as sophisticated, as cool, as acceptable. they did it by using celebrities and this is exhibit 3955 01:10 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 3956 they legitimized smoking in a way sports figures. that had never been done before. smoking accepted and expected of people in this country. they made and the rise of the cigarette in this country was also the result of an opportunity that reynolds and philip morris saw in america's youth. it was their choice to intentionally and systematically target young people, 13 and years old like sal marchese, to get them started smoking as early as possible. that is attract, addict, repeat. addict, repeat. what they did. although it was illegal to market or sell cigarettes to children from as far back as 1900s, we saw evidence that is that what happened. attract, they studied youth marketing. ask yourselves why would they study youth marketing if they had no intention of marketing to youth? you do not study youth marketing unless that is your plan. they designed advertisements to attract young smokers. smokers or their business was never going to survive because old smokers would die. you saw internal youth marketing documents from reynolds and from philip morris showing that these two they knew that they needed youth 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:11 01:12 01:12 01:12 01:12 01:12 3957 corporations marketed to kids when sal marchese was a boy in the 30s and they did it in the 60s and the 70s and the 80s. here's an example: exhibit 146, "younger adult smokers have been the critical factor in the growth and decline of every major brand and company over the last 50 years. they will continue to be just as important to brand companies in the future for two simple reasons. the renewal of the market stems almost entirely no more than 5 percent from 18-year-old smokers. the brand loyalty of smokers start after age 24. of 18-year-old smokers for outweighs any tendency to switch with age." now, we are not going to go through every you guys saw a lot of documents. but here's the point: i document. think the last thing you want to do is see them all again. we showed you documents from reynolds going back to before sal marchese was born and we showed you documents from the 50s up through the 70s illustrating that they continued this conduct for decades. when you go back to that jury room, read them, look at them up close. opportunities, about the choices that reynolds and those documents will show the squandered 01:12 01:12 01:12 01:12 01:13 01:13 3958 philip morris made to target kids to get them as customers, and those documents tell you a true story because documents do not die and they do not lie and they do not misremember and they do not change their story. they did not bring you any witnesses to explain them or tell you that what is said in those documents was not what was meant because the story the documents tell is indisputable. what other choices did reynolds and philip well, morris make that brought you here today? they chose to make a product that was highly addictive and they engineered it to sustain addiction. as far back as 1950s, they chose to publicly dispute and deny it for decades and decades in my lifetime. and although they knew about addiction here's one internal document proving they knew all about addiction. you remember this one? addiction." this is exhibit 96. "why do people smoke? here's exhibit 76. "in a sense, the tobacco industry may be thought of as being a specialized, highly ritualized and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry. tobacco 01:13 01:13 01:14 01:14 01:14 3959 products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug, with a variety of psychological effects." they knew all about nicotine and reynolds and philip morris not only addiction. appreciated that they were getting people like sal marchese hooked on a potent drug, but that in their design and advertising, it was their intention to stress the pleasures of the drug and not the disease-causing components. this is exhibit 72, this is the nordyne another one that is in evidence. this is a claude teague, senior scientist at he says, "most of those who have smoked not only study. did reynolds and philip morris know that nicotine was addictive and the reason people continued to smoke, but they were concerned that people like sal marchese would quit if they could. document 1982. reynolds. for any significant time would like to stop. many, but not most of those who would like to stop most who want to stop smoking are able to do so. are not able to quit." this is their own senior scientist making this observation, this admission about nicotine and addiction. that is their words. 01:14 01:14 01:14 01:14 01:15 01:15 01:15 01:15 01:15 01:15 01:15 01:15 01:15 01:15 3960 and let us be clear, it is been done throughout the course of this trial, they have tried to posture that this was some low-level scientist. those are his words, that is binding on that company. the companies speak through their employees. this is an employee of this company, this is exhibit 94. it was founded by reynolds and in 1980, the tobacco institute, which was, you heard from dr. proctor, one of the eight arms of the conspiracy that he talked about. philip morris as part of their play to deny and dispute the health risks of cigarettes. and they said in an internal document, "the lawyers remind us, i'm told, the entire manner of addiction is the most potent weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer/cigarette case. we cannot defend continued smoking as free choice if the person was addicted." that is what reynolds and philip morris were saying privately about cigarettes in 1980. if addicted, choice for smokers goes out the window. courtroom? marchese exercised his free choice to smoke. but what do they tell you now in this that smoking is a free choice and sal 01:15 01:16 01:16 01:16 01:16 01:16 01:16 01:16 01:16 01:16 01:17 3961 internally, they were talking about something different. once addicted, it is no longer an unconstrained free choice for the smoker because of the physiological and psychological need for cigarettes containing nicotine. philip morris knew that internally for a long time and their own documents attest to that. reynolds and philip morris and reynolds never told the public, people just like sal marchese, the truth about the addictive nature of the potent drug that they were selling. denied it, they disputed it. their customers on a potent drug, and they denied it was addictive. instead, up until 2000, they they were hooking this is exhibit 67. (video playing.) "let me begin my questioning on the matter let me of whether or not nicotine is addictive. ask you first, i'd like to go down the row whether each you believes that nicotine is not addictive. i heard virtually all of you touch on it, just yes do you believe nicotine is not addictive? or no. i believe nicotine is not addictive, yes. mr. johnson. 01:17 01:17 01:17 01:17 01:17 01:17 01:17 01:17 01:17 01:18 01:18 01:18 01:18 3962 congressman, cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definitions of addiction, there is no -- we will take that as a no and, again, time is short, if you could just -- i think of each you believes nicotine is not addictive, i just would like to have this for the record. i do not believe that nicotine or our products are addictive. i believe nicotine is not addictive. i believe that nicotine is not addictive. i believe that nicotine is not addictive. and i, too, believe that nicotine is not addictive." (video ended.) mr. pendell: that was april 1994. in 1950s and 60s, r.j. reynolds and philip morris are internally referring to nicotine as a potent drug and, in 1994, they are walking into congress raising their right hand and swearing under oath that nicotine is not addictive. by the way, i do not know if you noticed, but the same definition of addiction that the reynolds ceo is arguing with congress about in this video, that is the same definition that their 01:18 01:18 01:18 01:18 01:18 01:18 01:18 01:18 01:18 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 3963 expert, dr. kaplan, was applying up -- in courtrooms up until the year 2000, decades after it was out of date. r.j. reynolds and philip morris's choices do not stop at denying and disputing the addictive nature of nicotine. they also chose to focus the design and the engineering of their cigarettes to sustain addiction and to make people think that they were getting a safer cigarette. dr. proctor told you and showed you documents about how they put filters on cigarettes to assure smokers and he told you that those filters did not actually work. people thought they were getting a safer cigarette and they were not. it was a gimmick to keep people smoking. r.j. reynolds and philip morris had opportunities to disclose to the public, to their loyal customers the health risks of smoking, but, instead, they made the choice not to. heard in the early 1950s that there were some studies done that caused great concern in the those halls of reynolds and philip morris. studies were linking cigarettes to disease. but reynolds and philip morris, they were gathering their own information and conducting their own now, you 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:19 01:20 01:20 01:20 01:20 3964 studies and reaching the same conclusion, that cigarettes caused serious diseases like lung cancer. they could tell the public the what did once the link to cancer and other diseases was made by reynolds and philip morris, they had three choices. truth, say nothing, or deny and dispute. well, in 1953, you saw that they choose to do? reynolds and philip morris and all of the other tobacco companies, they met with a public relations firm called hill & knowlton in new york city in the plaza hotel, although -- and what went on behind the closed doors there was secret for decades. philip morris and the other tobacco companies, they made a secret agreement and that agreement was that they were going to do everything that they could to create doubt and controversy about the emerging health risks of smoking. they want to call them into question for one purpose, to keep people smoking. and this campaign of doubt and controversy, as you saw, went on for almost 50 years. why, why did they do it, why did they want to keep people like sal marchese smoking from learning about the truth about addiction and that and, at that meeting, reynolds and 01:20 01:20 01:20 01:20 01:20 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 3965 cigarettes could cause disease? this is exhibit 86. "suppose everybody smoked just one cigarette less a day, that would be maybe 40 billion a year." cigarettes a year. was their motivation. that is why they did it, that 40 billion so how did they do it? and this is exhibit 3, this is the frank how did they make well, how did they create the doubt that happen? and controversy that was necessary to keep their smokers smoking and from buying into the fears that cigarettes could cause disease like copd and lung cancer? well, one of the first things they did, and you saw it, was they made a promise to america. statement. and, in it, they promised that the public's health was their paramount concern and that their products were not harmful and that they would cooperate with the public health authorities and that they would fund research. and they also told smokers that the health charges against smoking had been abandoned for lack of evidence. and as you learned over the course of this trial, these two defendants broke every single one of those promises repeatedly. what else did they do to further this 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:21 01:22 01:22 3966 that included they created the eight arms of campaign? conspiracy that you heard about. the tobacco institute and the research group called tirc, which later became ctr. the public was told that tirc was designed to do independent and clear research on the health risks of smoking. the tirc/ctr, it was created actually to promote cigarettes and protect them -- it was part of their strategy, part of their efforts to work as a cohesive group to keep information from people like sal marchese, and it lasted for 50 years. now, we showed you internal documents proving that this campaign of doubt and controversy was conceived, engineered and implemented by these two defendants and that it was successful in maintaining the social acceptability of cigarettes in this country for almost 50 years by their own internal documents, documents they kept from people like sal marchese, in his lifetime. his lifetime, there was never any doubt and there was never any controversy, reynolds knew, philip morris knew that cigarettes caused disease like lung cancer and they knew it in the 1950s. they knew there was no doubt and they knew there was no almost for the full amount of 01:22 01:22 01:22 01:23 01:23 01:23 01:23 01:23 01:23 01:23 01:23 01:23 01:24 01:24 3967 controversy for every single year thereafter. what did they choose to do with their this was may 1972. this is they chose knowledge about the health risks? exhibit 83. repeatedly to deny and dispute that smoking caused disease, that smoking caused lung cancer. they repeatedly claimed there was no scientific basis for linking smoking to disease. studies which conclude now, in the 1980s -- this is the next one, john, exhibit 2 -- r.j. reynolds and philip morris implored the public to engage in "an open debate about smoking." and they said, "can we have an open debate about smoking? that smoking causes diseases have regularly ignored significant evidence to the contrary. the scientific findings come from research completely independent of the tobacco industry." there were legitimate scientists all agreed no such studies. smoking causes lung cancer. the only dispute legitimate dispute about that. about that was the dispute manufactured by these defendants to keep people like sal marchese smoking. there was no how do we know that it worked? how do we how do we know that these know that it worked? 01:24 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 3968 how do we know that? false statements were heard and relied upon by sal marchese? well, first, dr. proctor told you all about the polling that was taking place that showed smokers were not getting the message and we also know, because if you look at this chart, after the surgeon general's report came out in 1964, what happened? consumption continued to rise. accident. that all these millions of people just did not care it was going to kill them? it was a direct result of the strategy that these two defendants employed. cigarette that was no that was no accident. do you believe now, it was because of all this stuff that we have been talking about, all these squandered opportunities, bad choices and evasion of responsibility by philip morris and r.j. reynolds that we have the engle case. you heard about it from my colleague in the beginning in the opening and you heard about it during the judge's instructions to you. in the 1990s, there was a class action filed on behalf of all florida smokers who have suffered or died from a smoking-related illness, that trial which includes copd and lung cancer. 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:25 01:26 01:26 01:26 01:26 01:26 01:26 3969 they determined first that the second, that lasted for over a year and, at the conclusion of that trial, the engle jury determined several important things. nicotine in cigarettes is addictive. smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer and copd. third, that philip morris and reynolds placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous. finding that mr. oliver is going to talk to you about in a little while. they also made some other up on the screen is the actual definition -- can you go to the definition of the engle class, please? next one, next one. this is the actual definition of the engle class. and it is going to be up to you when you go back into that jury room, your job is to determine whether or not sal marchese is a member of this class. that is what all this has been about. that is why you are here. and to determine whether or not sal marchese was a member of this class, you are going to have to answer three questions and i'm going to go through them and talk about them in a minute, but, first, i want to talk to you about -- mr. oliver talked to you in the beginning about the 01:26 01:26 01:26 01:26 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 3970 you remember he showed you lady burden of proof. justice with the scales? abe lincoln, who most us know as one of our greatest presidents, what some people do not know is he was also a great trial lawyer, one of the best, and what made him a great trial lawyer was his ability to take a complex legal concept and make it simple so that the farmers and laborers that he represented could understand it. and in talking about the burden of proof and what it meant to have to prove his case by the greater weight of the evidence, mr. lincoln explained that if he took a single grain of wheat -- mr. cofer: objection, your honor, improper argument, improper analogy. the court: mr. pendell: overruled. if you took a single grain of wheat and placed it on his side of the scales of justice and it tipped ever so slightly in his favor, he would established his burden. so keep that in mind when you go back into the jury room to make a decision as to whether or not mr. marchese fits into that class definition. now, what do you have to decide? i'll tell you first at the outset, there is going to be 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:27 01:28 01:28 01:28 01:28 01:28 01:28 01:28 01:28 01:28 01:28 3971 no question on that verdict form asking you could you are not going to find it on sal marchese quit. there. he tried, but he did not. he did not quit. but it does not matter. the only thing you need to decide is was he addicted and, if so, was it the reason that he smoked so many cigarettes over the course of his life that it caused him to get sick. to help you answer this question, we brought you dr. tonia werner. dr. werner is a forensic psychiatrist, a medical doctor and the program director for the division of forensic she told psychiatry at the university of florida. you all about her experience treating addiction of heroin and cocaine and nicotine. that addiction has two components, it has a physical component and it has a psychological component. you learned that nicotine actually changes the structure and the function of your brain. she taught you sal marchese had no choice about nicotine crossing his blood-brain barrier. he had no choice about the effect nicotine had on his acetylcholine receptors. those caused physical withdrawal symptoms if the body does not get its required dose of nicotine. 01:28 01:28 01:28 01:29 01:29 01:29 01:29 01:29 01:29 01:29 01:29 01:29 01:30 01:30 01:30 3972 you also learned from dr. werner that even memory tracks cause an addicted smoker after the physical symptoms of withdrawal are gone, there is a psychological addiction that continues. like sal marchese to crave cigarettes in certain situations, times, places. those things provide cues. they trigger an addict -- an addicted smoker's memory of smoking and they last for years. dr. werner told you that she used three tools to assess nicotine addiction and she applied all three of these to sal marchese and she concluded that sal marchese had a severe addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine. dr. werner also told you that the age of it is well initiation of a smoker matters. established in the medical community that smoking as a teenager means that you are more likely to get addicted. she told you another symptom of the evidence in addiction is heaviness of smoke. this case was that sal marchese started smoking at or 14 years old and that he smoked compulsively two to three, sometimes more, packs of cigarettes the a day for more than 50 years of his life. evidence in this case, the testimony from the 01:30 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 3973 people who actually knew him was that sal marchese was a chain smoker and sal marchese was chained to smoking. dr. werner told you that another symptom of addiction is that a person interrupts important life activities to smoke. trudy marchese and his daughter theresa irwin both told you that sal could not sit through an hour-long church service without having to go outside to smoke. marchese told you that when she and sal would go to the movies in later years when they no longer allowed smoking, sal marchese would have to get up from that movie and he would sometimes sneak off into the bathroom to smoke in private because he had to have a cigarette. trudy trudy marchese, who slept in the same room with sal marchese for 46 years, told you that that man got out of that bed every single night of his life, sometimes twice, to smoke. sal marchese had his first cigarette of the day when he woke up. his daughter said she would see him lounging in bed smoking and it scared her, it scared her because she was afraid the bed would catch on fire. both dr. werner and the dsm-v that you 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 3974 saw, they told you that smoking in places where it was dangerous, and they both gave the example of someone smoking in bed, it was a tell-tale sign of addiction. before he went to sleep at night was have a cigarette. the last thing that sal marchese did dr. werner and the dsm-v both told you that another tell-tale sign of addiction was continued smoking despite knowledge of harm. sal marchese was diagnosed with copd, a life-threatening lung disease, he kept smoking. why? why would he keep smoking? sal's wife trudy marchese, his daughter when addiction. theresa irwin and granddaughter roseanne gorman, they told you that when sal tried to quit or when he went without cigarettes for any extended period of time, he was irritable, grouchy, jumpy, he was not the fun-loving guy they knew. outside, go to neighbor's, walk around the yard to try to keep himself from smoke, but he could not. he could not do it. he would go trudy even told you that sal returned a carton of cigarettes once because he was intent on they also told you that in those quitting. instances when he would try to refrain from 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:32 01:33 01:33 01:33 01:33 01:33 01:33 01:33 01:33 01:33 01:34 3975 smoking, as soon as he smoked a cigarette, he went back to his normal self. you heard all three of them tell you that sal marchese set off an alarm in an airport because he went outside to smoke. he had to get his fix. now, counsel for philip morris suggested to you that maybe he just did not see the large letters indicating that it was an emergency exit for authorized personnel only. dr. werner told you that all of these things prove that sal marchese was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine. you heard dr. werner tell you that nicotine addiction was the principal reason sal marchese was unable to quit smoking. ladies and gentlemen, nobody asked you to check your common sense and good judgment at the door when you entered this courtroom. in fact, i submit to you that is why each you have was chosen to be on this jury, because everybody wanted you to bring your common sense and good judgment with you into that courtroom. you did not need to hear dr. werner testify to convince you what your common sense and good judgment already tells you, that sal marchese was an addict. you heard that there are people out there that smoked sometimes 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:35 01:35 01:35 01:35 01:35 01:35 3976 that are not addicted. those people may smoke one cigarette a day, sometimes only on weekends, out with friends. marchese was a guy who smoked all these cigarettes in a day (indicating). that is how many cigarettes sal marchese smoked (indicating). that was not sal marchese. sal your common sense and good judgment tell you that someone who smokes 30, 40, 50, 60 or more cigarettes a day, day after day, 7 days a week for 365 days a year, that is addiction. sense and good judgment tells you that sal marchese was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine because people who are not addicted do not continue to smoke after they are told you have a life threatening lung disease. your common you heard his granddaughter, sal marchese this was not a man who had a death he was not some fly-by-night risk taker. loved life. wish. that was not sal marchese. your common sense and good judgment tell you that sal marchese was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine because on the day that he was sent home from the hospital with a terminal illness and told that he only had a very little time left on this earth, instead of making peace 01:35 01:35 01:35 01:35 01:35 01:35 01:35 01:35 01:35 01:36 01:36 01:36 01:36 3977 with his god or calling his old friend to tell them he loved them or talking with his wife and his kids, he was thinking about cigarettes. you heard trudy tell you how horrible it was for her to watch this guy who was paralyzed from the waist down trying to climb out of his bed trying to get one last fix. if that is it does not make sense. not addiction, it does not make sense. defendants talked to you about sal marchese's coma in 1972 and they have been trying to convince you this whole trial that sal marchese started on day zero when he came out of that coma. they want you to forget about the almost 30 years of his life that he smoked compulsively 40, 50, 60, sometimes more, cigarettes a day his whole life. they want to pretend it did not happen. they want you to forget about the fact that as soon as he came out of that coma, he asked his wife for cigarettes. they want you to believe that smoking is not an addiction but a slight annoyance that you can will yourself past after a couple of uncomfortable days. sal marchese was asking to smoke when he awoke from a coma because of a psychological addiction because it was something that he did 01:36 01:36 01:36 01:37 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 3978 every 15 minutes of his life for 30 years. smoking was like breathing for this man. needed cigarettes to function. about that 30 years of behavior, that 30 years of memory track, that 30 years of compulsive smoking. six weeks in a coma does not erase that 30 years. so do not forget he let us talk about the second part of the the judge told you that the term "legal first question that you are going to have to answer, which is whether sal marchese's addiction was the legal cause of his copd and his lung cancer. substantial cause" means a substantial cause. cause simply means that it just has to matter. that is all it means, it just has to matter. it explains what happened, it tells you why mr. marchese smoked 40 to 60 or sometimes more cigarettes a day for 50 years. that is all it is. mr. marchese's death certificate states that he had lung cancer and copd, and that lung cancer killed him and that copd contributed to his death. now, you heard from dr. gravelyn a pulmonologist and a professor at the university of michigan medical school, he told you that lung it was cancer is a signature disease, right? 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:38 01:39 01:39 01:39 01:39 01:39 3979 unheard of before the invention of the modern cigarette. it is a disease that reynolds and philip morris manufacture and sell. chart already. country correlates with the rise of cigarette consumption. you saw the the rise of lung cancer in this copd is similar. you heard from dr. gravelyn, dr. polsky and even dr. frazier agreed that 80 to ninety percent of copd in this country is caused by cigarette smoking. dr. gravelyn and dr. werner both told you that smoking one cigarette does not cause disease. diseases like lung cancer and copd are caused by repeated exposure to the carcinogens and the irritants in smoke over an extended period of time. lung cancer, repeated exposure to the dangerous chemicals and carcinogens and irritants in the cigarettes that he smoked day in and day out 40 to 50 to 60 or more times a day. that is what caused mr. marchese's copd and but why? why would sal marchese smoke all those cigarettes year after year in a sufficient amount to cause copd and lung cancer? because he needed nicotine. function properly without it. his body would not well, you heard 01:39 01:39 01:39 01:39 01:39 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 3980 mr. gentry, okay, he is a reynolds employee, tell you that nicotine is one of the fundamental reasons people smoke. you heard several times throughout the ask yourselves why. course of this trial that these defendants tried making a cigarette without nicotine and nobody bought it. because people are smoking for nicotine. addiction caused him to smoke more and more every day and it was those millions of doses repeated over and over again for 50 years that led to his disease. that is all that means. mr. marchese's now, reynolds and philip morris brought think about that. dr. kaplan told you that you dr. kaplan. addiction can never cause disease, remember that? tried to tell you that the only people that could be members of the engle class were drunks and mental defectives. gets paid to come into courtrooms like this and tell you that none of these people are addicted to cigarettes. scientific report or the medical study that supports his opinion that addiction does not cause disease, none, could not tell us one. i do not need to tell you why there is no literature that he told you there is not a single dr. kaplan 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:40 01:41 01:41 supports that. dr. kaplan and dr. werner both agreed on one thing and that was the dsm-v is not a tool that lay people like us, we cannot just run through a checklist and check them off. thing they agreed on. and run through the criteria with you and try to tell you what should be checked off, i'm just a layperson, but in the end, what you are going to have to decide is which one of them to believe. that is the best i can do for you. i'm not going to stand here it is the one do you believe the doctor from the university of florida who has no personal financial interest in these cases or the guy who gets paid $1.6 million to come into a courtroom and say that 25 percent of smokers in these cases are addicted whereas, in his own private practice, it is fifty percent. the definition that reynolds' ceo was arguing about before congress decades after it was no longer looked upon as a legitimate definition by the public health community. to decide who you believe. the same guy who was applying you are going to have i want to say one more thing about legal you heard the judge tell you that there cause. 01:41 01:41 01:42 01:42 01:42 01:42 01:42 01:42 01:42 01:42 01:42 01:43 01:43 01:43 01:43 3982 could be multiple causes of mr. marchese's copd and lung cancer. the only cause, it just has to be a cause. me give you an example. addiction does not not have to be so let i've always loved rivers since i was a kid it is amazing, and some of the biggest, and i lived a mile from a world-class trout stream. most beautiful brown trout you will ever see in your life come out of that river, but the river, in some spots, the banks are lined with old mills. if two of those mills were to dump toxic chemicals into that river and either one of those toxic chemicals is enough to kill those fish and all the fish died, they are both legal causes. that is all it means. so this is the verdict form that you are going to have when you go back to the courtroom and you will see the question 1, "was salvatore marchese addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine and, if so, was addiction a legal cause of his copd?" this far more than the greater weight of the evidence. check yes. so, when you go back there, you should we have proven this, we have proven the second question you are going to have 01:43 01:43 01:43 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 3983 to answer is, "did salvatore marchese's copd manifest on or before november 21, 1996?" judge told you that manifested means when his copd first manifested itself and he also told you that manifested itself means when mr. marchese was diagnosable. the how do we know that mr. marchese was because he was diagnosed in diagnosable? january 1995 by dr. saltzman. trudy marchese and theresa irwin both told you, they both testified that it was dr. saltzman that diagnosed mr. marchese with copd in january of 1995. marchese testified that shortly before the diagnosis, she noticed the change in his breathing, she could actually start to hear his breathing at times. she told you what she meant by shallow breathing was that it was audible to her. exhibited any signs or symptoms that are commonly associated with copd. prior to that, mr. marchese had never trudy trudy marchese told you that sal went to his primary care physician, dr. norensberg, who listened to sal's chest and he heard something he did not like. saltzman. so he sent mr. marchese to dr. theresa that was here in florida. 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:44 01:45 01:45 01:45 01:45 3984 irwin testified to the same thing. this is the record of sal marchese's visit this is 3018a and b. you saw it again today with it is dated with dr. saltzman. dr. frazier. january 1995 and dr. saltzman testified that that is his signature, that he was the one who wrote copd under the diagnosis. that copd means chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. diagnosis and then sign this document after he met with the patient. he also testified it was his practice to write the dr. saltzman did not remember sal marchese, okay? like many doctors who treat lots of patients, this visit took place over 20 years ago, but dr. saltzman testified to some very important facts. first, contrary to how it is tried to be presented here in this courtroom, dr. saltzman was unequivocal in his testimony that if he wrote copd, based on his experience and his training and his integrity, he believes that that is what he believed mr. marchese had at the time he wrote it. that was his testimony. dr. saltzman also testified that what he thought that code, the bronchospasm code, the 94060, just looking at it, he thought that that 01:45 01:45 01:45 01:45 01:46 01:46 01:46 01:46 01:46 01:46 01:46 01:46 01:46 3985 and that is a test was the code in 1995 that he would have used to do a pre and post bronchodilator spirometry. what did you learn about that? that is used to make a determination as to whether or not someone has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. dr. saltzman testified he would never claim to have performed a procedure that he did not perform for the sake of getting reimbursed by an insurance company. he also testified that if he, indeed, did a pft test, looking at that code, he believes that is what that was indicated, that if he had given that test, the results would have been available to him at the time and that diagnosis would have been based on mr. marchese's clinical presentation, his history and that pulmonary function test. right there in his office. if he would have had the results now, you heard testimony from dr. gravelyn, you also heard testimony from dr. frazier about what that the 94060 means. heard the judge instruct you that cpt codes are promulgated by the ama. medicare patients are required by law to use them. dr. frazier admitted that doctors across this physicians who treat you also 01:47 01:47 01:47 01:47 01:47 01:47 01:47 01:47 01:47 01:48 01:48 01:48 3986 country use those codes, they are standard codes. that is what it means. so what is the point? these are uniform. what does that a test was given to this man and the fact dr. gravelyn told you the code 94060 means pre and post bronchodilator spirometry. mean? that dr. saltzman does not remember does not mean it did not happen. defendants brought dr. frazier here to dr. frazier does not have the convince you that sal marchese did not have copd because dr. frazier has not seen a pft test. think about that. he actual results of the test, dr. saltzman did. dr. saltzman was the was the diagnosing doctor. diagnosing doctor. what dr. frazier is trying to do 20 years later is come into this courtroom and second-guess what dr. frazier did -- i'm sorry, what dr. saltzman did at the time. we do not have all the records that were that is not trudy generated for sal marchese. marchese's fault, that is an accident of time. that happens to everybody, but you saw other -- and how do we know that that diagnosis played out? well, let us use our common sense again. you also you other records indicating from that day 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:48 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 3987 forward, there were records indicating that other doctors were aware that this man had copd. so you have exhibit 3036, this was dr. polsky you heard him months after the copd diagnosis. was dr. norensberg's partner. testify that is dr. norensberg's handwriting, he was the one who checked those boxes and he checked ask yourselves, if this man was the box for copd. not diagnosed with copd by dr. saltzman, why is he being treated for copd by dr. norensberg? is that a coincidence? maybe it is a coincidence, but this is not the only record we have that shows that other doctors treated this man as if he had copd. okay. we also have -- john, 3029a. okay. this was the june 22, 2002 record from dr. he was also one of the mr. humberto porrata. dr. norensberg, marchese's treating physicians. who was the primary care physician, was copied on this record. first page. is required for this patient because of this patient's history of copd." again, we have yet another doctor who was aware that this man had copd and indicates they have to monitor his let us look at the middle of the it says, "monitored anesthesia care 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:49 01:50 01:50 01:50 01:50 3988 anesthesia because of it. but the defendants want you to believe that copd here does not really mean copd. and i show you another record from the same doctor that did not say copd, but it said, "because of his longstanding smoking history," and what did dr. gravelyn tell you? longstanding smoking history in and of itself, that does not affect anesthesia, it is the longstanding smoking history that causes you to have a lung disease, that is why you have to monitor somebody's anesthesia. just the here's exhibit 3015. this is a may 5, 2004 medical record signed by dr. polsky, a treating physician who testified in this courtroom before you, who knew sal marchese, who laid hands on sal marchese, who evaluated sal marchese, who had access to sal marchese's medical files and he told you mr. marchese went to the hospital because he also told he was having shortness of breath. you it was his impression at that time, the time he actually met with mr. marchese, that mr. marchese was having a copd exacerbation. polsky discharged him with several medications. theophylline, albuterol, humibid la, all of which dr. 01:50 01:50 01:50 01:50 01:50 01:50 01:51 01:51 01:51 01:51 01:51 01:51 01:51 01:51 01:51 01:51 3989 even dr. frazier admitted are used to treat copd. this is a medical he was another this is exhibit 3009. record from dr. frankowski. treating physician that actually spoke to mr. marchese, actually laid hands on mr. marchese, actually had access to mr. marchese's doctors. and according to dr. frankowski, sal marchese had rather severe copd at the time that he treated him. dr. frazier and his tobacco clients want you to believe that dr. frankowski did not really mean copd when he wrote copd. this is exhibit 3016. this is dated may 13, 2004 and this is from dr. polsky, again. and dr. polsky notes in his record that sal marchese has a longstanding history of chronic pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chronic bronchitis being a cigarette smoker, and you learned over the course of this trial that chronic bronchitis is a form of copd you even heard from caused by cigarette smoking. dr. frazier that chronic bronchitis is a form of copd. is this just another coincidence? all these records, is it just a coincidence that all of these doctors are noting that this man has 01:51 01:52 01:52 01:52 01:52 01:52 01:52 01:52 01:52 01:52 01:53 01:53 01:53 01:53 01:53 3990 that is common sense and good that is a lot of coincidences. copd? that is a lot of mistakes. judgment tells you what you need to know about whether or not sal marchese had copd. also notes in this record that mr. marchese had chronic shortness of breath and chronic cough, which are hallmarks symptoms of copd. you heard dr. frazier tell you that chronic in the medical lexicon means longstanding. dr. polsky now, dr. frazier eventually admitted that he had no evidence to dispute those pulmonary findings of chronic shortness of breath and chronic cough. just another coincidence. this is exhibit 3013 and this was a on page 2, under consult from dr. khosravi. atrovent current medications, it lists atrovent. is another medication that is used to treat copd and you heard that from both dr. gravelyn and from dr. frazier. mr. marchese has copd. on page 3, dr. khosravi notes that this is exhibit 3012. this is the discharge summary for mr. marchese. notes again that mr. marchese has copd with chronic bronchitis. notes that he has lung cancer, he did not do away and, by the way, he also dr. polsky 01:53 01:53 01:53 01:54 01:54 01:54 01:54 3991 with the copd diagnosis, he did not say, well, we thought it was copd and now we know it is just lung cancer. lung cancer. he says he is got copd, he said he is got dr. polsky signed it. finally, this is the death certificate, exhibit 3021. you heard him testify about it right here in this court. this is testimony from his treating physician, a man with no dog in this fight. a man whose only he worked concern was to treat a human being. with mr. marchese's regular treating physician. dr. frazier even told you that these are vital records. out. from his mouth. tries to be as accurate as possible because they are government documents. that he has no doubt in his mind on the day sal marchese died that he had copd. that came he fills them out as well and doctors are careful when they fill them they want them to be accurate. and dr. polsky told you ladies and gentlemen, it is more than a decade after sal marchese died and these defendants want to come in here and challenge all these doctors that actually treated mr. marchese, that actually saw his records, that actually conducted exams, that actually conducted pft tests 01:54 01:54 01:54 01:54 01:54 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:55 3992 let them do it. on this man. we have shown you the records from seven different doctors, all of whom actually laid hands on sal marchese and all of whom agreed that he had copd. that evidence cannot be outweighed by the testimony of dr. frazier. you heard testimony from theresa irwin and her daughter roseanne gorman that they remember sal having shortness of breath and chronic cough roseanne in the 1990s after he was diagnosed. told you all about when they went to italy and they were taking a walk in assisi and sal marchese could not make that walk because of exertional shortness of breath. he did not have lung cancer at that time. it is -- that lung cancer he had was a fast lung cancer, it happened in a matter of months. sal marchese did not have lung cancer that was affecting his breath in the 1990s when he went to italy; those are symptoms of copd. you heard dr. frazier that they want you to believe that testimony is they want you to believe that mrs. not true. marchese is not telling you the truth. the audacity to come into this courtroom after lying to the public health authorities, after they have 01:55 01:55 01:55 01:56 01:56 01:56 01:56 01:56 01:56 01:56 01:56 01:56 3993 lying to the american people, after lying to their customers for almost 50 years and they want you to believe that this family is not telling you the truth about sal marchese's illness. do not let them do it. now, there is no dispute that sal dr. marchese's lung cancer was caused by smoking. so we have proven by the frazier even agreed. greater weight of the evidence, by that one grain of wheat, we have proved that sal marchese's copd manifested prior to november 21, 1996. so, when you go back to that jury room, you should check yes for number 2. now, number 3, ladies and gentlemen, is you have to answer whether or not okay. easy. smoking cigarettes manufactured by each defendant if you was a legal cause of mr. marchese's death. get past question 1 and 2, this one is easy. mr. marchese only smoked the defendants' product. he smoked lucky strikes and dorals manufactured by reynolds, and he smoked marlboros and benson & there is no hedges manufactured by philip morris. disagreement that it was smoking cigarettes that caused lung cancer. there is no disagreement that that is eventually what killed him. 01:57 01:57 01:57 01:57 01:57 01:57 01:57 01:57 01:57 01:58 01:58 01:58 01:58 3994 there is no evidence that mr. marchese's copd was caused by anything other than cigarettes. remember, 80 to ninety percent of copd in this country is caused by cigarettes. no evidence that mr. marchese had any other risk factors for copd, none. defendants. you should check yes for number 3 for both now, let us talk about the fourth question and i'm going to sit down and let mr. oliver talk for a while, finally. question 4 is comparative fault. defendants have told you throughout the course of this trial that they bear no responsibility for what happened to sal marchese, they want you to believe, despite the fact that they manufactured a dangerous and defective product, despite the fact they marketed this dangerous, defective product, despite the fact that they did it to young people like sal marchese and to sal marchese, despite the fact they spent more than four decades concealing the health risks and addictive nature of that dangerous and defective product, and despite evidence that they did everything they could do to manipulate that dangerous and defective product to keep sal marchese hooked, that all the blame 01:58 01:58 01:58 01:58 01:58 01:58 01:58 01:58 01:58 01:59 3995 belongs to mr. marchese. you to do. that is what they want but they have done nothing to prove that sal marchese was negligent, and as the judge told you, that is their burden of proof. that is the one thing they bear the burden of proving. marchese did what they wanted him to do. bought their cigarettes by the carton, smoked 40 to 60, sometimes more, cigarettes a day for years just as they wanted him to do. sal he you remember -- john, this is the slide of mr. heimann. you heard mr. heimann. he was the former ceo of american tobacco, the company that brought you lucky strikes, and he told you that he wanted people like sal marchese to buy their cigarettes, to smoke them and buy more. and, in fact, he said he would not blame somebody for smoking a pack or two of their products every day, that is what they wanted people to do. get your daily fix. to be a loyal customer. how could sal marchese be negligent for doing what they wanted him to do? product. used. how could that be negligent? he used it as it was intended to be he bought their he used that 01:59 01:59 01:59 02:00 02:00 02:00 3996 product without full knowledge of the harmful effects, without full knowledge of the addictive nature and without knowledge that they were manipulating those cigarettes to keep him addicted. if you make a product that is going to kill or harm people in this country, you have the responsibility to tell your customers that information. you do not get to come into a courtroom and say you should have known it was harmful. you have to take responsibility. take responsibility. that is not how it works in this place. they have to now, i expect reynolds to come up here in their closing argument and tell you they are not to blame because mr. marchese mostly smoked marlboro, which are manufactured by philip morris, but the evidence says otherwise because we know that, at a minimum, mr. marchese smoked lucky strikes for at least eight years and dorals for two. years of toxins. doubt significant doses. that, at a minimum, at a minimum, was that is millions of puffs, no and the evidence suggests that he probably smoked reynolds' brands for more than 10 years 02:00 02:00 02:00 02:00 02:00 02:00 02:01 02:01 02:01 02:01 02:01 3997 so the evidence is he was probably was because he was smoking lucky strikes when he met trudy marchese and he was smoking several packs a day. smoking them longer and we know his father was smoking lucky strikes. we also know that it was one of the most popular brands at that period of time. and the dorals also mattered. the fact trudy marchese told you it mattered because when the price of they were bargain priced cigarettes, that mattered. cigarettes went up, it provided a way for sal marchese to keep smoking. that he switched to dorals because they were cheaper. so the dorals mattered, the price mattered, and each one of those cigarettes was a brick in the road that led sal marchese to copd and lung cancer. mattered. each one of those bricks now, trudy marchese told you that she cannot blame sal because he started smoking at age 14. he did not know anything about cigarettes when he started, and he was addicted. agree with her, that sal does not bear responsibility, that is okay. here. that is why we are whatever you decide, she will live with. you may not 02:01 02:01 02:01 02:01 02:02 02:02 02:02 02:02 02:02 02:02 02:02 who controlled the advertising? but when you are thinking about comparative fault, when you are thinking about how much of this responsibility belongs to reynolds and philip morris and how much belongs to sal marchese, ask yourselves who had the power? information? manipulated the cigarettes to sustain addiction? who denied, disputed and concealed the information about the health risks for over four decades? who squandered the opportunity to change the course of history for sal marchese and smokers just like him by telling the truth? place profits over people? who refused to take responsibility for what happened for over four decades? it was not sal marchese. who made the choice to so think about that when you are trying to decide how much blame to place on reynolds and philip morris and sal marchese because they deserve the lion's share of responsibility. now, briefly, defendants tried to convince you over the course of this trial that sal marchese knew that smoking was dangerous to his health as far backs as 1961 when his dad had a heart attack. the surgeon general of the united states, a trained doctor, that defies logic. who had the who 02:02 02:02 02:03 02:03 02:03 02:03 3999 did not come to the conclusion that cigarettes were injurious to health until 1964 and they want you to believe that a high school dropout bricklayer knew in 1961 that it was cigarettes that caused his father's heart stake. that. think about finally, with regard to mrs. marchese's breast cancer, they want you to believe that mr. marchese was on notice because his wife got breast cancer, but trudy told you that she and sal did not discuss it, her doctors never told her definitively that smoking caused it. that the advice to quit smoking was personal to her. cancer. '73, that is not unreasonable. she did not think that men could get breast that is not unreasonable in 1971, '72 or she believed you saw that many people in this country did not know about the health risks of smoking, including after the surgeon general released his report, that is how that happened. that lack of knowledge continued because of the things that these defendants did. so how can you blame sal marchese for that? how can you blame an addict for that? so i just ask when you go back to that 02:03 02:03 02:03 02:03 02:03 02:04 02:04 02:04 02:04 02:04 02:04 02:04 02:04 02:04 02:04 4000 jury room and you have to decide how to rack up fault in this case, keep those things in mind. i'm going to turn it over to mr. oliver. i appreciate it. mr. oliver: counsel, thank you. good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. we are in the home stretch and i'm sure you all are glad and i'm not going to get up and tell you that i'm going to be brief, i'm going to try, okay, and but hopefully i will. i think i can at least fulfill my promise to try. thank you for your patience and your attention. it is such a pleasure to work with people like mike who have a passion for their clients and what we do. my job is to talk to you today about the claims that we did not discuss much during the opening and those are the fraud and i'm also going to talk to you conspiracy claims. about trudy marchese's damages and whether philip morris's and reynolds' actions over 45 years are worthy of punishment. so let us jump right into it. let us go to fraud and concealment. i'm going to talk to you about these questions together because fraud and concealment, really, they are slightly different -- excuse me, 02:04 02:04 02:05 02:05 02:05 02:05 02:05 02:05 02:05 02:05 02:05 02:06 02:06 02:06 02:06 4001 the conspiracy claim goes with the fraudulent concealment claim and then the conspiracy claim. it, it means they committed fraud and they concealed stuff and they got together and they agreed to do it. here's the point: the key information that you are going to have to determine with these questions is whether sal marchese relied on something that the defendants said, something the defendants knew but did not say, or something that the defendants did as part of their conspiracy. so the question number 5 reads, "did salvatore marchese reasonably rely to his detriment on any statement of material fact made by each defendant that concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available to him concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes and, if so, was the concealment a legal cause of salvatore marchese's death?" here's what reliance means: it just means that we have to prove more likely than not that something they said or they did not say affected mr. marchese's decision. the judge has already provided you with the law and instructions in this 02:06 02:06 02:06 02:06 02:06 02:06 02:06 02:06 02:06 02:07 4002 i'm not going to go through them in depth, case. but i want to highlight three of the most important things when you are looking at the issue of reliance. first, there is no requirement that philip morris and reynolds ever made a statement directly to mr. marchese. and that is makes sense because in this country and in any country where you have advertisements or you buy products from companies, i do not call up kraft foods when i'm going to buy some cheese and say, hey, kraft, can i have some cheese? package of kraft and there are things written on the package of kraft, there are advertisements about the package of kraft cheese, but that is their communication with me. the messages they put out. i go to the grocery store and i pick up a so the instructions you are going to get will say, and i am going to read directly from the instruction to make sure that i get it right, it will say, "it is not necessary that a direct statement be made to the representee in order to give rise to the right to rely upon the statement, for it is immaterial whether it passes through a direct or circuitous channel in reaching her," 02:07 02:07 02:07 02:08 02:08 02:08 02:08 4003 should be him in this case, "provided it be made with the intent that it shall reach him and be acted upon by the injured party." and we talked about now, i think the evidence is in this case that the messages that reynolds and philip morris sent out there to everybody, i think the evidence is that those messages got to sal marchese but even if they directly in many instances. did not, you heard dr. proctor talk about the concept of causes of causes. this, we showed a marlboro advertisement of the father and son, he talked about how sal marchese's whole family was smoking and all of his friends were smoking. generation were smoking. did not get that message directly from reynolds and philip morris, i guarantee you the evidence shows that he got it from his family and his friends and his peers and that environment that they created. so it is okay if it did not get to him directly. i think the evidence shows that it did, but i wanted to explain that because it is something you do not deal with every day. 75 percent of people in sal's and if sal marchese the second important aspect of reliance is sal's reliance only needs to be reasonable. this: 02:08 02:08 02:08 02:08 02:08 02:08 02:09 02:09 02:09 02:09 02:09 02:09 4004 and that is important because you have to look at where sal came from, who he was. he was a bricklayer, he did not graduate high school. have to look at his environment, who were his he is not required to have taken the best peers. course of action. he is not required to have been one of those scientists who knew what was going on with the defendants' cigarettes. you okay. you heard some evidence about a doctor, i think it was a doctor in great britain, who had written about addiction to cigarettes in the british medical journal in like the 20s or the 30s. recognizes that. reasonable for the place and times that he was in given his education and given his situation. he is not a doctor, he is not at the top of the profession, you do not hold him to that standard. that is not sal marchese and the law his reliance only needs to be and i would submit to you that you have heard evidence from dr. proctor about how many doctors were smoking. if it was reasonable in that time for the head of the american medical association to go tell people i'm smoking a bunch and i do not think it is a problem for me, you heard him say that, if it is reason for more than 02:09 02:09 02:09 02:10 02:10 02:10 4005 fifty percent of doctors to be smoking during that time, for astronauts to be smoking during that time, then it is more than reasonable for sal marchese, the bricklayer, to have believed the health messages he heard, the false, the misleading health messages he heard from defendants and to have relied on those statements and smoked their cigarettes. so this is the framework that i want you to remember, but what is it that sal marchese actually relied on? we have talked a lot about so that is the first thing that sal advertising. marchese relied on. when he was a teenager, i am very certain that the evidence we presented shows you that he had that message. it was out there, it was ubiquitous, it was everywhere and he got it. i also want you to remember that it is these advertisements about what they did not say. typically did not say this is healthy, what they did was they gave you a positive reassurance of, well, these are the type of people who do this and what is important is they knew things internally that they did not put in the advertisement. they never put somebody on an advertisement lugging an 02:10 02:10 02:11 02:11 02:11 4006 they did not tell people about and they did not oxygen tank on his or her back and they never put somebody on an advertisement getting an operation for lung cancer. those things and they knew it. say in their advertisements, hey, you can do this, but once you start, you may not be able to quit. that was information that they had and they did not put in their advertisements. before 1999, they never said their so they never said what they really knew, before 1999, they and this went on for decades. never said their products caused cancer and copd. they never said their products were addictive before 1999. cigarettes were a habit that people could not break. and before 1999, they never said that their own research confirmed what the public health authorities were saying. and that is important. some people were saying it, but the defendants themselves, philip morris and reynolds, believed it internally and they did not come out and say we believe it. because it is important not only that they dispute it. now, even today, you heard the ceo -- or, excuse me, you heard an employee of reynolds who was on reynolds' leadership team and you heard a 02:11 02:11 02:11 02:12 02:12 02:12 02:12 02:12 02:12 02:12 02:12 02:12 02:13 4007 research scientist, dr. jupe, for philip morris say that even today, they will not admit, this was 2011 was when their testimony was given, that addiction causes disease. so how do we know? what is the evidence that sal got this message and he relied on it? well, let us go back to that video that i showed can we switch over? you, mr. cullman. you hit that play for us there, john? okay. can (video playing.) "and we have got the one ad that we sent to new york, january 5, 1955, and in 30 days, marlboro was the number one brand in new york, just from that one ad, passed all other brands and that was quite an achievement. time, were the smallest cigarette company in other companies were in tv and we just business. going around to restaurants in had that one ad. new york and you see that marlboro box and, you know, i knew went had something." and we, at that (video ended.) mr. oliver: can you highlight something on the left side of that picture there? can you highlight the text on the picture of the ad, is that possible or not? 02:13 02:13 02:13 02:13 02:13 02:13 02:13 02:13 02:13 02:14 02:14 02:14 02:14 i want you to notice something, i'm going it talks about the flavor and the flip top to talk about this a little bit later, but it says -- part of the advertisement, this is when marlboro is new and when it is coming out and, remember, we heard about how important filters were. box and it says, "be glad you have changed to a filter." about the cowboy, it was about health. about there is a health scare, be glad that you have switched to a strong man's cigarette with a filter. that you are older cigarette did. that is going to deliver the same flavor that is important because it was not just it was so joe cullman just told us about the power of advertising, 30 days, new york city, top of the market. that is how powerful their ads were and we know that sal marchese relied on that because that is one of the brands he chose. did not smoke an off brand, he smoked a brand that they pushed and that ultimately became the best selling cigarette ever. he now, we are talking about marlboro and be glad you chose a filter and that is important because, remember, sal marchese started with lucky lucky strike was an unfiltered cigarette strike. 02:14 02:14 02:14 02:14 02:14 02:14 02:14 02:14 02:14 02:15 02:15 02:15 4009 they later developed a filter, for the most part. but during sal marchese's early smoking years, lucky strike was not a popular filter brand. you heard evidence that american tobacco company sort of got left behind and that philip morris got its entree into the market by introducing marlboro with the filter. and american tobacco and lucky strike, they never took full advantage of that. and that tells us that sal marchese was getting the message, the exact message that they wanted him and every other smoker to get to reassure them about their worries on health. let us look at the heimann slide. what did robert k. heimann, the former joe cullman for philip morris told us advertising worked. ceo of american tobacco brands, they manufactured lucky strike, what did he say? he summaries, this is not exactly his testimony. wanted the public to believe that cigarettes were not injurious to their health and he thought people could rely on the statements that they put in their advertising and that people, when they were smoking the company's cigarettes, they were doing exactly what the company wanted them to do. these are next slide, please. 02:15 02:15 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 4010 and he said, "would you agree that the amount of money spent on advertising had a pretty direct correlation in 1970 with the units sold of that product? i certainly would agree with that. there has to be that correlation. that is the purpose of advertising, is not it? yes. and you would not spend on advertising if it did not work, would you? we try not to." and we also saw -- can we go to exhibit 580, john. this was the berger and we also saw this: it was from the files of brown & study. williamson, which is now owned by reynolds. it tells us that in 1946, when sal marchese is years old, roughly the same time that he is experimenting for the first time with cigarettes, lucky strike hits their all-time peak of 103.5 billion cigarettes in 1946, when they are spending money on the brand, when they are advertising, when they are pushing them to the top of market, sal marchese is choosing the brands 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:16 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 4011 there were a lots of that they are pushing. brands out there and some were not promoted as heavily as lucky, some were not promoted as marlboro, but sal marchese chose the ones that they promoted the most heavily. and the berger study concludes by saying that "the rise and fall of every brand of consequence has been traced in detail in their year-to-year success or failure shown to be the direct result of consumer so we know it worked because their advertising." employees have told us it worked, they spent money on it and we have seen studies, their own studies that show that it actually worked. if i get into a now, finally, we know that he relied on their messages because sal marchese did exactly what they wanted him to do. situation where i'm buying a car and i say i want a car with good brakes and the guy at the car dealership says i've got a car with good brakes and i say, well, i'm relying on your statement that this car has good brakes. i go down the hill and it does not have good brakes, we all know why i relied because he made a direct misrepresentation and i told him this is important to me. but this is a concealment case and the 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:17 02:18 02:18 02:18 02:18 4012 problem with this proving reliance in a concealment case is simply that it is hard to know how somebody would have reacted with information that you never share with them. so you have to look at the circumstances and you have to look at their actions. if the message was to do this and the person went out and did what they wanted them to do, then that is evidence of reliance. so what else did sal marchese rely on he besides defendants' advertising messages? relied on the defendants to tell the truth about their products and to make an honest product. remember, when their conspiracy started, they concealed this knowledge that their products were addicting and killing people, and this is when filter cigarettes were rising. now, talking about filter cigarettes, earlier during the trial, i do not know if you will remember, we published from exhibit 806. did not have a witness talk about it, we just read some of the pages of it. wondering what we were doing. this is a presentation giving inside of philip morris in the 90s, it is looking back and somebody is talking about the history of where the you might have been we this is evidence. 02:18 02:18 02:18 02:18 02:18 02:18 02:19 02:19 02:19 02:19 02:19 02:19 02:19 4013 filter cigarettes offered what cigarette market was going. suddenly, because of the smoking and health publicity, this is in the 50s, filter cigarettes became not only acceptable but necessary. smokers perceived -- not what was a health benefit, we heard there was none, what they perceived as a health benefit. morris, who is making marlboro, this is their entry into the filter market, rises from 9 percent of the market in 1953, number 6 in line, you heard joe cullman say it, to 42 percent of the market in 1989. and that philip and they are still on top. it was filter fraud. they not only got the message out there through their advertising, they got it in there through their box and they got the fraud out there through their product. they manufactured a product and made you think it was better for you, and then later, they did not tell people this, but people later learned that it is absolutely no better for you to smoke a filtered cigarette. it is just as addicting, it is just as likely to cause cancer, it is just likely to cause copd. and sal marchese relied on the company not to make a product in a way that was intentionally deceptive to him. 02:19 02:19 02:19 02:20 02:20 02:20 02:20 finally, mr. marchese relied on there could have been a lot of reasons. i do you remember well, we know this because defendants' campaign of doubt and controversy. how do we know this? mr. marchese kept smoking, which is what the campaign wanted them to do, and he did not try to quit in the 50s and the 60s and the 70s. well, why? think one of the reasons is this: when dr. werner was on the stand and she talked about the concept of information having power? and i asked her a question that was basically, you know, do you tell people that they have a problem when you are trying to get them off a drug? she says yeah. them? addict, they need to know that they have a disease. if they do not know that they have a disease and they do not know that they have a problem, they do not understand the nature of what they are dealing with, they will not know that they need to make a plan. and and i said why, why do you tell because they need to know they are an the defendants have made a big deal about the fact that somebody needs to make a plan to quit smoking and i believe the evidence shows that one of the reasons that mr. marchese, like so many 02:20 02:21 02:21 4015 people, did not make a plan is because he did not realize how big the problem was until it was too late. until he was coming out of a coma for two months and saying i want a cigarette. until he is in the 80s telling his daughter -- at that point, yeah, in the 80s, yeah, i think by the 80s, he probably figured out he had a problem because he was telling his daughter do not let the baby smoke. do not let roseanne smoke because, once she does, she is never going to be able to quit. and that is when he knew he had a problem. how would his life have been different if the defendants had come out in the 50s and 60s and said, hey, this is not just a little thing, it is easy to blow off, this is a disease, it is a problem, and in order to get off it, you are going to need some help? so he relied on their campaign of doubt and controversy. but they did not do that. and can we look at 86? this was the forwarding memorandum and i this is right when want to show you how early. the conspiracy is formed. some hill & knowlton professionals, their pr people that were hired to go out and combat the this is a document from 02:21 02:21 02:21 02:21 02:21 02:21 02:21 02:22 02:22 4016 and they are public health claims of cigarettes. recounting some of the things they heard the cigarette industry men saying at a meeting. it says, "one of the men said it is fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they cannot break." 1954. cigarettes are a habit you cannot break? they had done that, then the world might be a different place, but they did not do that. and they did not do it until 1999. what if they had come out and said, folks, well, if so that is how mr. marchese relied on the fraud of philip morris and reynolds, but was his reliance reasonable? i said he has to be a reasonable man during this time period, right? well, let us start with the engle findings. and that is important because we looked at these earlier. philip morris and reynolds were negligent -- i'm sorry, number 5, "philip morris and reynolds concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the concealed or omitted information was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes so you start with the engle findings, or both." 02:22 02:22 02:22 02:22 02:22 02:22 02:23 02:23 02:23 02:23 02:23 02:23 02:23 02:23 02:23 02:23 4017 the engle jury found that the information that was out there was material, it was important, and the jury instructions -- this is what the jury instructions say about material information that the jury found they withheld that kind of information. "material information is information that is of such importance that a reasonable person would consider same significant in their decision-making process." information and the information they withheld was so important that a reasonable person would think of that in making their decision. that is number one. so they withheld okay. so number two is, "not otherwise known or okay. that is important because dr. available." proctor talked to you at length about some of the information that was publicly available. and we make no dispute, there was information out there about cigarettes being harmful and, in fact, that is why defendants had to get together and form their conspiracy. if they had not gotten together and formed their conspiracy, the world might be a different place because the public health authorities were starting at that time to realize 02:23 02:23 02:24 02:24 02:24 02:24 02:24 02:24 02:24 02:24 02:24 4018 something was going on. scientists were doing the mouse skin painting studies and this stuff was in the news. but, remember, those are not the things we are talking about, we are talking about things that were not otherwise known or available, and we have shown you things that were not otherwise we have shown you defendants' known or available. own internal files and that they understood the severity and extent of addiction long before the public health authorities and other scientists in the public had called on and, certainly, long before sal marchese ever did. so the information that they hid was important and it was stuff that, frankly, only they knew. but this is the final piece of the puzzle that i want you to consider and this is not -- you know, this is not an instruction. is just something that i think goes to what my colleague mike was talking about and that is the common sense nature of this inquiry. when you are thinking about reliance, you have to consider the quality of information, you have to consider the quantity of information, and you have to consider the source of the information. this 02:25 02:25 02:25 02:25 02:25 02:25 02:25 02:25 02:25 02:26 4019 so we talked about how philip morris and reynolds were the fathers of mass communication. they had the marlboro man, and i've got a great blowup of one of the marlboro men here. okay. can everybody see that? is one of the greatest advertising campaigns ever. so the quality of their false message, the quality of their reassurance message was top notch. was the best in the business. everybody got it? this it the box that they made was a success. you heard joe cullman talk about the box, because they hired an ad man to create it. a box manufacturer did not create the packaging for marlboro, an advertising executive created it. that. actually designed the box. wrapping some stuff up in some paper, it was, hey, we are going to make this part of our ad campaign. somebody who an expert in advertising was not just like i'm think about and when they conspired to create doubt and controversy about the health effects of their products, they put that same -- the same level of resources, they put the same level of ingenuity and they put the same power behind that campaign as well. that was the big ad that they ran after the you heard about the frank statement. 02:26 02:26 02:26 02:26 02:26 02:26 02:26 02:26 02:26 02:27 02:27 02:27 02:27 02:27 02:27 4020 conspiracy started where they made a bunch of promises to the public. was in all the major newspapers and all the major news services in new york. lie to people, they did it right. and that, you know, it when they wanted to they also -- so they have the quality. and they had the quantity. it was not just like one ad or two that is what i'm talking about, the quality of the they had information. the exposure. ads, as soon as they realized they had that marlboro man, it was working, bam, it was everywhere. i do not know if you remember this, but when cullman was talking about the marlboro man, when they first started and it became so successful, he said he went back and they did the marlboro country. so it went from marlboro man, it went from one guy or girl or a series of men to marlboro country, the whole world, right, and that is how it became. so they had the quality and they had the they hired -- i do not know if you quantity. remember the evidence about the third party strategy, but there was an article in true magazine that was suggesting that there was still 02:27 02:27 02:27 02:27 02:27 02:27 02:27 02:27 02:27 02:28 02:28 02:28 02:28 02:28 02:28 4021 and if a controversy about smoking and health. you will remember, dr. proctor told us that the guy who wrote that was hired by the tobacco industry, it was not disclosed, and that they then ran that fake article in other publications under the names of other fake authors who did not actually write that article. so they had quality and they had they had that message, it was good the quantity. looking and it was everywhere. so you have to compare the quality and quantity of reynolds' and philip morris's campaign to keep people smoking to the public health message and the sources of information that were out there. i think dr. proctor told us that over the course of history, there was something like 30 articles, give or take, in reader's digest about the dangers of smoking. the number of articles that were actually in reader's digest ever and it was, you know, a ridiculous comparison. and then he gave you 30. can we see the slide? question: "do you know what the difference in spending on cigarette advertising was versus psas?" remember, psas were the bill that talman and the yul brynner advertisements. 02:28 02:28 02:28 02:28 02:28 02:28 02:28 02:28 02:28 02:29 02:29 02:29 02:29 02:29 02:29 02:29 4022 and he said they had an was powerful stuff. "well, there is no impact on some people. it is like a snowflake versus a comparison. snowstorm. the estimates are that there is more spent by the cigarette industry in one day than the health association spent in a whole year on these public health messages." so you compare the quality of what they were doing and the quantity of what they were doing with the contrary message. understand whether mr. marchese's choices were reasonable under the circumstances. that is how you now, finally, the source matters. the now, what do i source of information matters. mean about this? well, in order to figure out if mr. marchese relied on something, you are really asking would something in his life have changed, would the informational environment have changed such that he might have made a different choice? so you have to imagine a world in which all of these things defendants did, either did not happen, either that they did not do them, or that when they did them with the same quantity and quality that the public health messages out there. happened, what would have happened if the source so what 02:29 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 4023 of the negative information about smoking was defendants themselves and what would have happened if, instead of putting all of that money and power behind the wrong information, they put it behind the right information? so i've got an example i want to use. now, this and i've got a and you get the message, but this is we have got the marlboro man right here. is one of those first ads, right? little bubble drawn up in the marlboro man's mouth, this is the one you like, popular, filter, price. from -- this is a quote from plaintiff's exhibit 70. what if the marlboro internal statements. man had said, "without the chemical compound, the cigarette market would collapse. collapse and we would all lose our jobs and our okay. consulting fees"? plaintiff's exhibit 70. document from the tobacco companies. that was from that is an internal this is one of philip morris's okay. pm would what if in 1953, before the conspiracy ever started, there were ads out there saying, "the studies of clinical data tend to confirm the relationship of heavy and prolonged tobacco smoking and the incidence of lung cancer"? that is 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:30 02:31 02:31 4024 from a reynolds document. obviously, i know reynolds did not run the marlboro man ad, but the point is what if the defendants had gotten out there and said we agree? what if they had said, hey, this is bad stuff and we agree? do not need to do it, it is bad for you. they had done that with the same force and effect that they put out their false messages? if you want to do it, fine, but you what if and what about this: this is one -- this is this philip morris or reynolds? nonetheless, it is "younger adult smokers sal was a philip morris -- this is plaintiff's exhibit 146. i believe it is reynolds. plaintiff's exhibit 146. are the only source of replacement smokers." if he knew that the marchese was a family man. defendants were internally calling teenagers and young people replacement smokers, do you think he might have tried to find a way to quit or a way to not give that company his money? i think he might have if he knew what they really said, if he knew what the truth was. so that is the world you have to imagine, and i think the evidence is that if defendants had done this, if they had put forward the right 02:31 02:31 02:32 02:32 02:32 4025 message with the same force that they put forward the wrong message, the world would be a different place and people like sal marchese would have quit and they would have been able to get the help and they would have known that they needed to get the help. so he relied on that controversy. and the other reason we know that he did because even is because of this (indicating). though all that information came out and you have this little dip in the 50s and you had these little dips where the surgeon general's report comes down, doubt and controversy, the conspiracy keeps that thing going up. so we know that not only sal marchese relied, but millions of other smokers relied. remember, i promised you at the beginning of this you would learn something new about cigarettes and cigarette smoking, and i think i made good on my promise. this is 2015, with all the information we have and all of the things we know, it does not make sense that in 1940 and 1950 and 1960 that sal marchese knew all of the things they claim he knew or should have known. it just does not make sense. so can we have the elmo? 02:32 02:32 02:32 02:32 02:33 02:33 02:33 02:33 02:33 02:33 02:33 02:33 02:33 when you get to questions 5 and question and i want you to philip 6, i'm asking you to check yes. remember something about conspiracy. morris and reynolds and all the companies were in it together. at any time, one of them could have broke that conspiracy. could have said i'm through with this, it is wrong, we are not doing it, i'm out. that. in '55, philip morris they never did reynolds could have done the same thing. they could have gone public, they could have said these other guys are lying to you, our products are killing people, but they did not do it. so we are asking you to check yes on questions 5 and 6. the next question that you will look at is now, if we prove engle the damages question. class membership, even if you do not agree with us on the fraud claims, you still have to get to the damages question. if you answer questions 1 through 3, you will go to comparative fault and you will go to damages. even if you do not answer yes for us in the fraud counts, i want to make that clear. you know, damages is difficult. how do you place a monetary value on the things that 02:34 02:34 02:34 02:34 02:34 02:34 02:34 02:34 02:34 02:35 02:35 4027 well, it is not easy. trudy marchese lost? the judge's instructions will say something to the effect of there is no exact standard for fixing compensation. you have to do what is fair and just, and if you believe she is been damaged, you have to give her a full measure of compensation for the damages. and that is the loss of sal's companionship, the loss of his protection, and her mental pain and suffering for that loss and for watching her husband trying to crawl out of the bed when he is got a tumor wrapped around his spine and get a cigarette. so she is lived 11 years without her and after husband, she is lived 11 years without her lover, she has lived 11 years without a best friend and without the father of her children. that, she is watched a lot of good things in life go by that it might bring her joy, and she told us it would, just to have him see those things. she has not gotten to sit with sal and watch matthew and mason, her great grandchildren, because sal is not here. and if it were not for smoking, we think the evidence is that sal marchese would still be he did not have any major health problems here. 02:35 02:35 02:35 02:35 02:35 02:35 02:35 02:35 02:35 02:36 02:36 02:36 02:36 02:36 4028 that were not smoking-related health problems. she has lived 11 years without that and it is her loss, her 11 years without sal marchese. so what am i asking you for? we are asking you for $1 million for every year that you think she went without mr. marchese's loss or protection and companionship. now, what does that mean? that may sound like a lot of money, but let me tell you why it is not. that is that is $2,700 approximately a day. all. if trudy marchese had $2,700 and she could pay that for day of sal marchese's time for one more day, i guarantee you she would pay it and she would pay it over and over again until she was dead broke. marchese would have lived for 11 more years and that is fine, and you may not agree with my mathematical calculation. exact science. she would have had left with sal, fully and fairly compensate her for that loss. look, this is not an but whatever time that you think and you may not agree that sal do not undervalue the things that she lost. we have already seen how philip morris and reynolds value people's lives. they value them in dollars and cents. they do not mean anything to them 02:36 02:36 02:37 02:37 02:37 4029 all those things we talked about, emotionally. that does not matter to them. was up on that screen, consulting fees, we will lose our jobs and consulting fees, and we will not have anymore money. so, speak the language that they understand, dollars and cents. what they care about the final question on your verdict form is whether punitive damages are warranted by defendants' conduct. and we bear the burden of proving entitlement to punitive damages by clear and convincing evidence. that is a higher burden and i think we have met that burden. first, if you find for us on fraud and you award damages, punitive damages, there is not going to be any result for comparative fault if you find for -- excuse me, there are not going to be any reduction for comparative fault if you find for us on the fraud claims. form, it is just an important point that i want you guys to understand. and that is on your verdict second, remember what we have been talking about since the very beginning and that is the law requires you to treat corporations no differently than you would treat an individual. third, you can punish defendants only for 02:37 02:37 02:37 02:37 02:37 02:37 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 4030 conduct that harmed mr. marchese, but when you are punishing them, if you determine you should punish them, you can consider the harm that was caused to others by the same conduct that harmed mr. marchese. that is called reprehensibility. nature of what defendants did. determining what the nature of it was, like what did they really do, how bad was it really, you can look at all of the harm they caused to other people. did to mr. marchese. you can only punish them for what they the so when you are now, here's when punitive damages are i'm going to read directly from the warranted. "punitive damages are warranted if instructions. you find by clear and convincing evidence that the conduct causing injury to salvatore marchese was so gross and flagrant as to show a reckless disregard of human life or of the safety of persons exposed to the effects of such conduct. the conduct showed such an entire lack of care that the defendant must have been consciously indifferent to the consequences or the conduct showed such entire lack of care that the defendant must have wantonly or recklessly disregarded the safety and welfare of the public, or the conduct 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:38 02:39 02:39 02:39 4031 showed such reckless indifference to the rights of others as to be equivalent to intentional violation of those rights." intentional conduct justifies punitive the four things i damages without a question. just read to you are about reckless conduct. i think we can all agree that what they did was reckless and i think we can all agree that the evidence shows it was not just reckless, it was defendants intentionally sold also intentional. their products -- i'm sorry, my mouth is getting dry -- to children. and they designed their cigarettes to sustain we showed you documents and you heard addiction. testimony that they knew how much nicotine sal marchese and smokers needed each day and they made sure they gave it to them. because if they did not give it to them, the cigarette market would go out of business and we know that because when they talk about making a nicotine-less cigarette, nobody buys it. and when their executives get up in depositions in 2011, they talked about whether they are doing something about the addictiveness of their products, oh, no, they are doing all kinds of things to try to reduce risk, but they do not 02:39 02:39 02:40 02:40 02:40 02:40 02:40 02:40 02:40 02:40 02:40 4032 want to touch addiction because addiction for them means guaranteed sales. and you heard dr. werner. she got up with a flip chart and talked about opioids and we talked about benzodiazapine and heroin and cocaine. 2004 when sal marchese died, cigarettes were still killing 20 times as many people and it is like that every year. if you add all those up, in the year the court: mr. oliver: five minutes, counsel. ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it has been an honor to participate in this process with you. you know, the founding partner of my law firm used to tell juries that what they did will live forever in the halls of justice. and when i first heard that, i thought it sounded incredibly corny and then somebody explained it to me. you see, when we are done here, you guys are going to go home and go back to your lives and you will probably -- this is interesting, but you will forget about it at some point. and i do this all i'm an attorney, so it is my job and, the time. you know, i'll go on to the next task, but for trudy marchese and trudy marchese's family, this whatever happens here is going to live forever. 02:41 02:41 02:41 02:41 02:41 02:41 02:41 02:41 02:41 02:42 02:42 4033 lives forever. and for this county, for this hall of justice, your verdict is going to stand and it will be here forever. people will be able to know that justice was done or not done in this courtroom during this trial. philip morris and reynolds have opportunity after opportunity for 45 years to do the right thing and they chose not to and they are here trying to get out of it. and they do not want take responsibility for their actions, they want to lay that responsibility at the feet of a 14-year-old kid that they hooked. not to let them do it. i'm asking you thanks. mr. oliver: shall i proceed, your honor? yes, sir. ladies and gentlemen of the jury, let me be clear about one thing from the beginning of my rebuttal closing and that is this: the instructions say you are not supposed to make a decision based on sympathy. and i'm not asking 04:54 04:54 04:54 04:54 04:54 04:54 04:54 04:54 04:54 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:55 4127 and i made that clear when i stood up you for sympathy, i'm asking for fairness and justice. during voir dire and i said there is a burden and i have to meet it, and i made it clear that if i do not meet that burden, then you do not find for me. it is incorrect as a matter of so, when they talk about sympathy and they act like i'm trying to pull on the heartstrings, that is wrong. because fact, it is incorrect as a matter of law. the law says that when you make a product that is deadly and kills people, those people can come into court and they can seek compensation. this case is not about those people who have quit; sal marchese never did quit. it is not about those people who smoked for some period of time, even a long period of time, and did not get a disease because sal marchese did get a disease. if somebody comes to my office and they say i do not have lung cancer, i do not have copd, i've smoked for 20 years, can i bring a lawsuit. do you think i'm going to say? bring a lawsuit because you are not hurt. yeah, they did some bad things, but those bad things they did, they have not hurt you yet, but they did no, you cannot what 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:55 04:56 4128 hurt mr. marchese. and mr. isasi said that there were some things that happened 50 years ago; those things were during mr. marchese's lifetime. if you look at the punitive damages instruction, in fact, mr. isasi held up a board, what does this have to do with mr. marchese. marchese and that is when he lived. well, this is about mr. if you look at the punitive damages instruction, it says that you must punish them for things that are linked to mr. marchese and it says that if you find that we have met our burden, that you can punish to deter others. it is not just about deterring them from doing the same thing, it is about deterring other companies who would do the same thing in the same circumstances. but not only that, think about it, have let us let us be they really shown you a changed company? start with the tobacco working group. honest, that is a joke. and he said that when they got involved in the tobacco working group, they would not even admit -- they sent a letter and they said we will not admit that this causes cancer and we will not call this a safer cigarette because we do not want to admit dr. proctor explained that 04:56 04:56 04:56 04:57 04:57 04:57 4129 that our cigarettes are doing anything bad now. okay. that is a joke. the tobacco working group was disbanded, dr. proctor told us about that, because it was not successful. and the tobacco companies did not go after their customers, reynolds did not, philip morris did not and say, hey, guys, we cannot make a instead, they advertised their safer cigarette. filters and made light cigarettes and kept doing the exact same things that they had been doing for years. so when you hear those things, think about what reynolds lawyer told you, what does it have to do with mr. marchese. those bad things that happened a long time ago hurt mr. marchese. now they talked a lot about different things in mr. marchese's life, but what they cannot with to talk about was when he started smoking because it is clear that he did not know what was going on and that they did create that environment and that they did put that first cigarette in his hand. you know what else they did not talk about. you did not hear one word about the most important thing in this whole case and that is this 04:57 04:57 04:57 04:57 04:57 04:57 04:57 04:58 04:58 04:58 4130 of all the things that got to (indicating), okay? mr. marchese, this is what they make, right? talked about the kraft cheese example. kraft makes cheese. the most important communication that kraft has with me is the cheese that i eat from them. we the most important communication that the defendants had with mr. marchese was this product. and we have told you and we showed you documents, dr. proctor gave you an explanation of what they were doing with those products, that they knew exactly to the milligram how much nicotine somebody needed. and that when the market for cigarettes changed and went to a low tar market and that was part of the public health scare, that the defendants were looking for a way to get the same nicotine kick by manipulating the ph of the cigarette that they got in the past from a full flavor cigarette, one that delivered more tar, which is more carcinogens. a way to sustain addiction. they were looking for and if you want to know how we know that, look at plaintiff's exhibit 70. elmo, please? this was the one where they said, can i get the 04:58 04:58 04:58 04:58 04:58 04:58 04:58 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 4131 i you know, we will lose our consulting fees. showed you part of it, i want this as a reminder. they are comparing customers to rats. "consider the smokers. smoking the cigarette is the lever our task is to understand the reinforcing press. mechanism or process whereby the habit is established and maintained. such is our model." addiction was their model. you did not they hear anything -- they did not come in and we did not design these cigarettes to be addictive. absolutely did it, right, and sal marchese smoked those cigarettes and that is why they did not want to talk about it. they wanted to act like this never touched mr. marchese, but they touched mr. marchese 60 times a day every time he smoked one of their products. now let us talk about comparative fault. instruction number 8 says the defendants have brought an affirmative defense and that is comparative fault and that they bear the burden on that particular issue. so, when mr. cofer was talking about what to write in there, he said write one hundred percent on sal marchese. you have got to ask yourself, in the circumstances what did mr. marchese do, did he do 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 04:59 05:00 05:00 05:00 05:00 4132 we heard that cigarettes are a what was expected? legal product, so they have to prove that he did something out of the ordinary. there have been a lot of analogies about cars and i'm using cheese, and i do not know why i'm using cheese but that is just what i came up with, all right? but i thought about a car when i was sitting there and a car is a great example because in order for me -- if i get in a car wreck and i sue the company, i say, well, my car was defective and they want to say, well, comparative fault, right, you did something wrong. they have to prove that i did something reckless. legal product, i know generally how cars work and, you know, what they are doing and i'd have to prove i was not on my iphone, was not paying attention, i had the radio too loud. a car is a cigarettes are a legal product and the head of the company, mr. heimann, told you they expected people to smoke two packs a day and they did not put out an instruction that said do not smoke two packs a day. if you only smoke one cigarette a day, you will be okay. people that. supposed to do given the times that he was he was doing exactly what he was they never told 05:00 05:01 05:01 4133 surrounded by. you know, the other thing mr. isasi couple things about first of all, that was not the only brought out, which was fascinating, was the gallup poll. and you had the tirc, which is the tobacco industry research council. that. organization that they had on the payroll, right? the conspiracy had eight arms and there were advertisements that each company ran independently, but, more importantly, there was a bar and it says twenty percent for the american medical association in 1959. do you remember elmer hess, mr. i'd rather smoke than be a potato or whatever he said? remember, dr. proctor told you they paid the american medical association. take that 3 percent the tirc had and you might as well stack up twenty percent up on top of it. so you have got to when you are talking about third party sources like true magazine, whatever credibility those magazines have, you have to stack that on top of it, too, because the defendants were not dummies. notion of, well, nobody put a gun to the man's head and made him smoke cigarettes. you know, during voir dire we heard this i want to you 05:01 05:01 05:01 05:01 05:01 05:01 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:02 4134 okay. this is pretty interesting nobody put a gun to his head and ask you a question. theory. made him do something, but what is worse, if somebody goes to put a gun to somebody's head and make them do something bad, how many times is that person going to get away what that. that is a pretty overt thing, right? to my head and say go rob the store, eventually you will get caught, you might hurt two, three, four people. not many. you put a gun that is not what these guys did because they are way too smart and had way too much power and had way too much money. they tricked millions of people into doing something that was harming them and those people that were doing it did not even know it. making somebody do something wrong. mastermind tricking millions of people to do something wrong and that is exactly what happened, and that is exactly what that cigarette consumption chart shows us. so it is not like one guy with a gun it is like a now let us talk about two things and i'll be done because i want to be respectful of your time. diagnosis. first of all, i want to talk about the you know, we have heard a lot about 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:02 05:03 05:03 05:03 05:03 05:03 05:03 05:03 05:03 05:03 05:03 4135 this is common sense. this. basic, in my opinion. i mean, this is you know, dr. gravelyn said i would never you do not a doctor would never diagnose a patient based on a billing record and i do not agree -- i mean, i do not disagree. your job is not to diagnose mr. marchese. diagnose dead people. diagnose a dead person unless you are a pathologist cutting open a body. your job is determined -- is to determine what the evidence in the record shows and whether there was a diagnosis or not. you are not here to diagnosis him. dr. gravelyn was not here to diagnose him. dr. gravelyn was here to tell us that, as a medical doctor, based on evidence he sees, there was sufficient evidence for him to be very confident that there was a diagnosis of copd. medical records said copd, the billing codes said that a pre and post bronchodilator spirometry was performed. and dr. saltzman did not have a great memory, but he sure said, you know, it is my signature and i think that is what that code means. dr. gravelyn says i use that code all the time. that is what it means. he had the disease. the test was performed and that part is basic. 05:03 05:03 05:03 05:03 05:04 05:04 05:04 05:04 05:04 05:04 05:04 05:04 05:04 4136 the final thing i want to talk about just flabbergasts me. they continue to talk about the fact that mr. marchese was in a coma and they make it seem like that, in addition to being in a coma, he was also in a smoking cessation group, right. he was in a coma and there was a smoking cessation counselor there, and for two months, they had the discussion about how we need to deal with this. sal marchese that is not what happened. he made no decision during that and when he got out what was on i just got was thrown out of a vehicle and he was unconscious for two months. two months to stop smoking. of that coma, what was on his mind? his mind, what would be on your mind? thrown out of a car, i woke up from a coma. remember what trudy said? hello to was her friend named -- i do not remember her name, but i remember mrs. marchese testified i thought he would say hi to me first. sal just got out of a coma. first person he said we heard the dsm-v. you can still have we heard talk about people relapse when cravings. that is a pretty they are in stressful situations. if you are going to say that stressful situation. mr. marchese got a redo or a do-over or made some 05:04 05:05 05:05 05:05 05:05 05:05 05:05 05:05 05:05 05:05 05:06 05:06 05:06 4137 kind of fully cognizant decision to do this, you have got to come with something better than a guy who woke up from a coma, was clearly having cravings, asking for cigarettes the first day he he is out of the coma. of his life. at that time. he is in the worst situation that was the last thing on his mind i'm not asking you i'm ladies and gentlemen of the jury, i will end by simply reiterating this: i am not asking you to punish them because they are corporations. i'm not asking you to punish them because they make a legal product. i'm asking you to punish them because of what they did. to give my clients some kind of windfall. asking you, as is your duty, to look at what the what is it that she lost? value is that she lost. that is what the law says you have to look at. the law does not say you go out and look at what other people's average family income is. have not lost their husband or wife. we are valuing here. other things. with a spouse. simply asking for fairness and justice. we are valuing the loss of 11 years i'm not asking for sympathy, i'm those people that is what we are not valuing those ladies and gentlemen of the jury, i thank 05:06 05:06 05:06 05:06 05:06 05:06 05:06 05:06 05:06 05:07 05:07 05:07 05:07 05:07 05:07 05:07 4138 you for your time. your decision is, we will honor it and abide by it. i appreciate it. and whatever thank you.
