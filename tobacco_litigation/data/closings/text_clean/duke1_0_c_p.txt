mr. lantinberg: good morning. how are you? it was about a week ago that i had the first opportunity to introduce myself to you, and it was your first opportunity to learn a little bit about this case. certainly when you walked into this courthouse you had no idea whether you would be picked as a juror, what kind of case you might be selected on, whether it would be a civil matter or a criminal matter, and not knowing, you know, what the issue would be. you have learned an awful lot about george duke and his mother, sarah duke, and you have learned an awful lot about the tobacco industry and the design of cigarettes and nicotine and lung cancer, stroke, death certificates. 6 you have received a lot of evidence in a lot of different forms. you have received it in the form of live witnesses that sat right here. you could look at them, watch their demeanor, and evaluate for yourself the truth and veracity of their answers to questions both by myself, my co-counsel, and as well as r.j. reynolds. you probably have a unique understanding of the workings of the tobacco industry, more unique than perhaps the vast majority of people in this country. i've told you that there would be a great many things that we would show you and that there would be many things that we would not need to reprove. and her honor gave us a limited amount of time in that opening statement and i've got a limited amount of time with you this morning as well to try to close and bring together a lot of information. information in a trial unfolds in a, perhaps not the most ideal way. we have to bring in witnesses when they are available. i told you there was a great many pieces of evidence that were already in evidence, some of which have been talked about in detail, some of which have been glossed over in this case, and some of which have not been talked about at all. and all of that will be available to you to look at, and i'm going to try to point out as we go through this some of the important information and some of the other documents that i think are relevant. 7 this case has got several components, as you know. there is this class action component and whether or not sarah duke is class member, and we are going to talk to you about both the court's instructions that her honor will read to you at the conclusion of my presentation, as well as r.j. reynolds, and then there is a verdict form. and at the end of day this case is reduced down to this document. all of the witnesses, all of the documents, all the evidence, all of the disputes that her honor told you about at the beginning, her preliminary instruction she said this is a case about disputes. and we are asking you to resolve some very fundamental disputes that we were unable to resolve for ourselves. there was certainly some disputes that we were able to resolve. we have told you about smoking and sarah duke's smoked and that it caused her lung cancer, and we have told you about other facts -- and i'll go through some of those and i've got some slides to help refresh ourselves on that. i want to talk a little bit about really this place, this courtroom. there is been an awful lot of, if you will, pomp and circumstance, a lot of formality that is been forced on all of us, and it is been really out of respect out of this process that we call the jury system. you have noticed that we have not been able to talk to you if we see you in the hallways or see you downstairs. there is a rule. we are 8 not allowed to do that. her honor has, you know, governed this courtroom very strictly and very firmly, and it is out of respect for the process. the only thing that litigants, plaintiffs, defendants, individuals, corporations want when we come to a courthouse is justice. and her honor gave you a taste for how important that is at the beginning of this case in what we call voir dire in which there was -- obviously there were many more people seated in this courtroom and she asked a series of questions intended to bubble to the top, if you will, anyone's particular feelings or bias that they might have about this type of case or cases in general, about smokers that might bring lawsuits, about feelings that you might have about tobacco companies, feelings you might have about plaintiffs in general, feelings you might have about the rights of people to seek redress in a courtroom. and each of you took an oath. we all took an oath. we are all subject to an obligation to try to ensure fairness. the only thing that any one of us in this courtroom wants for either george duke, frank duke, his mother, sarah duke, or r.j. reynolds is fairness and justice. and whatever the outcome is, as long as it is been procedurally fair and substantively fair that is all anyone can ask you is that when you walk into a courthouse they get justice, and they walk out and say, well, i gave it my best 9 shot and whatever the outcome is, is the outcome. so, you know, we are all probably familiar with the image, the sculpture of the blind lady of justice. and it is worth talking about a little bit this morning because it bears on everything we are about to do here today. the blind lady of justice, as we all recall, is blindfolded and she is holding the scales of justice in her hands, and those scales are even and they are empty. and there is a number of important images there. first of all, the blind lady of justice goes to that issue of bias and impartiality. all we can ask for is that whatever bias or impartialities, impartialities that you did have when you came into this courthouse you leave at the door, and that you evaluate the evidence that we presented to you based on the facts and as instructed on the law and draw the conclusion and answer the verdict form questions the way that they are intended and the order in which they are intended. and the scales are empty and they are even. and that is an important imagery. that expresses the fairness goal that when everyone starts out in this courtroom they start out even, not with a little bit of influence on one side or a little bit on the other side. it is completely empty and it is completely even. and then of course your honor will tell you about the 10 burden of proof, which is the preponderance of the evidence. we are not in a criminal case. and we are all, you know, very familiar with the csi dramas and the quincys and the whatnot in which a much higher level of proof is required. in a civil action, and it is our system, all that is required is a preponderance of the evidence. and those scales of justice give us sort of a good way to think about that. and i'll give a simple example. if there was a car accident case in which there were a series of witnesses that came into the courtroom and one of those witnesses said, "i saw the light. the light was red. and i saw the driver go through the red light and strike the other car." that would be evidence in favor of one person or another on those scales. and you put some weight on that scale and it would carry the weight down and it would no longer be even. there would be evidence in favor of one party on that disputed issue. and if another witness came in and said, "i was there at the scene. i remember hearing the noise and i saw the crash but i was texting at the time and i did not see anything." that is not evidence of anything. there is no evidence presented in that circumstance that goes on the scale. and so if a second witness came in and said, you know, "i heard it too and i looked up and i saw the accident but i 11 was reading my paper," that is not evidence of anything. so as you evaluate the evidence that is been presented in this case, perhaps keeping that image in your mind will make it a little easier. and i say that because i think there is been an awful lot of what i would describe as distraction in this case. i told you this case is an engle class action case. her honor described that to you. and one of the threshold, initial things that needs to be established is that miss sarah duke is a member of the engle class. and the engle class definition, as i told you before, encompasses florida residency. not a dispute in this case. it involves an engle disease. lung cancer is a engle disease, stroke is an engle disease. it has to be a disease that is caused by smoking, and it has to be a disease that is caused by a lot of smoking, addicted smoking, addictive smoking. and counsel for the defendant spent really their entire case on these issues. i have told you a lot about the engle findings and that there were things that were proven that we did not need to reprove, and i explained to you those findings of negligence. the prior court had determined that engle class members are entitled to the finding that the tobacco companies, including r.j. reynolds, were negligent. negligent in their marketing, negligent in the design of 12 their product, negligent in the promotion of their product. i told you that there was a finding about strict liability. strict liability is a law in the concept when someone -- a concept in the law that when someone sells a product that is defective, that is unreasonably dangerous and it causes harm, the actor who put that product on the market is strictly liable. and there is a finding in that regard. and then we talked about this agreement to conceal that was formed between each of the major tobacco companies and culminated in the creation of a public relations arm called the tobacco institute and the tobacco institute research committee, and from the 1950s until the late 1990s that entity perpetrated scores of acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, in furtherance of the agreement to conceal, and the -- and flawed on the american public as well as the public health authority. so those are issues that need not be reproven, but we did present a fair amount of evidence in that area. you heard from dr. cummings and dr. burns, both of whom are -- both by education, by training and by choice, public health officials. they dedicated their lives to the advancement of public health, both domestically and internationally. they have been recognized for their work, not just by juries and courtrooms, but by their peers. they 13 have been participants and authors of just about every modern surgeon general report that is been issued, and you will have many of them here. this is the stack of evidence that will go back with you into the jury box. we brought to you these two experts to talk about -- i'm going get into some details, but i do want to talk about some broad areas. we brought these experts and we presented all these documents not because we had to reprove what we had to reprove, but because there is another claim in this case which is for punitive damages. and in cases of punitive damages we have to show more. it is not enough to say that it happened or have the unrebutted testimony of these experts come in. we need to show it. it needs to have sort of a force and effect that is meaningful. the court will instruct you that the standard of proof is even slightly higher, it is clear and convincing evidence. it is more than just simply the scales. but i mentioned this punitive damage point here at the beginning of this closing statement because i want you to consider all the evidence in that light as we move through it. so i also want to leave one more sort of general thought perhaps before i go into some of the details; and that is, think about the evidence that you saw, and think about what you did not see. what you never saw was any 14 executive, employee, janitor of the r.j. reynolds tobacco company walk through those doors, sit in that witness box and raise their right hand to tell you the truth. they never brought a witness in to talk about any of the documents that we showed you from the '50s, the '60s, the '70s, the '80s, the '90s. they never brought in a witness to rebut a single conclusion that dr. burns or dr. cummings talked about from the surgeon general's report, the national cancer institute, the power and import of those formally secret documents that became public in late 1999 or 2000 that dr. cummings described as in the tens of millions of pages. and we have only given you a sample here. and i would suggest to you that the failure to bring in anybody from the r.j. reynolds tobacco company, all they would have had to do was put them on $300 ticket from winston-salem and have them talk to you. they did not do it. and i think that is important. and i point that out because, (a), we have these engle finding that say what they say; (b), we have documents that show what they show; and we have the reports of the surgeon general and the national cancer institute and dr. cummings and dr. burns that conclude what they conclude. and they conclude about the design defects that we have talked about and the conspiracy that we have demonstrated and the negligence that we have asserted. and all of these things had an impact, not just on the 15 public but on sarah duke. sarah duke did exactly what they wanted sarah duke to do. she smoked the cigarettes they wanted her to smoke, she switched to the lights and the filters when they wanted her to switch -- and we will point out some of those periods in time as we go through this -- and they addicted her. so what i want to do is start with a little bit of information about sarah duke. and so here of course remember we have got some photographs of miss duke and her family, and we have got some of these stipulated facts that we know about that smoking was a medical cause of her lung cancer. not in dispute. this is really important. a medical cause of her lung cancer. it is also the legal cause of her lung cancer. we know that when it was diagnosed in january of '96, and that was, therefore, between those two dates in 1990 and in november of '96, those are some of those class action statute of limitations dates. and then we know that brown and williamson and american tobacco, you will see some of these other names on other documents, they are all r.j. reynolds. and also to the extent you see documents from any of the tobacco companies, they are all part of the conspiracy. they all are in furtherance of this concealment of the dangers and of the agreement to keep those things secret. 16 so we are going to talk about the verdict form which has got the first two questions, and here's an image of the verdict form. and as i said, at the end this is really all you are going to be doing. you are going to reduce all of these disputes down to the answers to a number of questions. and the first one is: do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that mrs. duke was addicted? and then the second one is sort of an extension of that is: did the addiction cause her lung cancer: did the addiction cause her death? the addiction to cigarette smoking. we know she smoked cigarette her entire life. that is really not in dispute. and these first two questions used the word "cigarettes." they do not use the word "defendant," they do not use the word "r.j. reynolds." class membership is brand blind, if you will. makes no regard to what you smoked. you are either in or you are out of the class. and you are either in because you were addicted and you smoked so much that you got the disease or you are not. and mr. furr told you in his opening statement this was one of the most important questions you will have to deal with in the case. and it is important for us, and it is important for them, because if you do not get past this they do not have to explain any of their conduct. they do not have to explain why they were negligent, how the defect hurt her, how the conspiracy was bad, why they engaged in the 17 fraud, why they should be responsible. so they want you to stop right here. and i think this is really fundamentally not that difficult to overcome. you heard an awful lot of evidence, and lot of time has been spent on this, and an awful lot of money was spent by the defendants to come in here and tell you things about sarah duke and that she was not addicted and all that and we will go through some of it. so the first question is -- is, was she addicted? and so we are going through the verdict form. we are going to talk about addiction. was she addicted? all right. so let us talk a little bit about the last witness that you heard from, and we will go a little bit in reverse here. you heard from dr. tucker. i'll call him the $84,000 man. they brought in an expert from california, a doctor who said, as a mouthpiece for the tobacco company, to tell you that she was not addicted to cigarettes, that she smoked for 53 years, no dispute about that; that she smoked with such force and regularity that she got lung cancer, no dispute about that; but that she was never addicted for a moment in her life that her switching to the winston filtered cigarette, which we know she did at around the time that they introduced it, they did it around -- she -- the winston cigarette was introduced in response to the health scare of the '50s, and they marketed it as a health reassurance 18 cigarette. she then switched in the late '70s -- we know this from laura duke -- to a light brand of winston cigarette. again another product that was sold as a reassurance cigarette. she did exactly what they wanted her to do, and she did it because she could not quit. they knew that if they marketed a filter where they marketed a light that it would be an alternative to quitting. and i do want to talk about quitting and choice because it is really, really important. but i want to talk a little bit about the facts that go to these addictions and then we will get into this concept of choice. so dr. tucker came in and he told you not addicted. dr. tucker told you that he uses a book, he uses the dsm-iv book, which on cross-examination was shown to him, that showed that 80 to ninety percent of smokers are addicted. but dr. tucker rejected that concept as simply inaccurate, really did not have much of an explanation for that. we know from all of the evidence, the surgeon general report, dr. cummings, dr. burns, that relapse rates are high, that the number of people that smoke and then are able to quit on their own is teeny. and yet dr. tucker came in and told you that these numbers are almost half within two trials. simply not the case. it is not supported by any law -- any facts rather, it is not supported by any 19 documentation. he simply came up here and said it, but i urge you to look in here for an article or a report that supports that proposition. it is an $84,000 opinion that was bought and paid for but is not supported. and they spent a lot of money to say "not addicted" because they do not want you to find that she is addicted. but you use your common sense. you decide. you know, so let us talk a little about, again, one of those addiction facts, and we will get there. i'm going to quickly blast through some these and then we will come back to it. the second question would ultimately be was the addiction a part of her death? the other three questions on the verdict form, and i'll show these to you really in the second part of my closing. fault and damages. and we will get to damages. all right. so here we know about addiction, 53 years of smoking, lung cancer, persistent use by disease, drug reinforced, and knowledge despite harm. we know the brands that she smoked and when she switched and why she switched. i told you about the filtered and the lights and then the merits. statistically miss sarah duke was a heavy smoker and she is the kind of smoker that they expect that grew and became a very important, valuable asset of the r.j. reynolds tobacco company between the '60s and the '80s, and certainly ultimately to her death in 1985. this is from the 1989 20 surgeon general report. you have this in evidence. it shows how much increase there was in heavy smokers, females in particular. as we talk -- i guess i want for a moment, talk briefly about sarah duke's quitting and the period of time between when she was told that she had a mass on her lung and when we are told she ultimately quit. so we know that in august or -- rather september of 1995 she had some x-rays, she ultimately has a -- in january she is told to start reducing her smoking and she does. and she reduces herself down to a quarter pack of cigarettes a day, which dr. burns reminded you is really the minimum level of addiction. she then went in and had some biopsies to have her lung tissue determined to be whether it was in fact cancerous. she was in for three days and after that she never quits -- she never smokes again. that is the evidence. she tried to titrate it down, and ultimately because of three days in the hospital and her inability to smoke she did quit. and she substituted -- one of these things that dr. tucker talked about was sort of substitution. she substituted for a period of time with alcohol. and there is some inconsistencies in what dr. tucker talked about with respect to the alcohol and we will get to that. so choice versus addiction. there really is -- remember dr. tucker talked about these lists of things that 21 people do and why they like to smoke. there is no evidence of that. there is no evidence that she chose to smoke for those purposes; rather, she smoked because she needed the drug reinforced nicotine. abnormal behavior, i mean, you know i always find it remarkable to talk about smokers simply doing it for choice and yet they walk across hot parking lots at lunch time and smoke, you know, on their own, in the -- huddled in the doorways of buildings where it is raining or where it is hot, they leave family gatherings when they are with their grandchildren or their family or at dinner to go outside and smoke. that is exactly what dr. burns and dr. cummings told you are the signs of an addicted smoker. persistent use, drug reinforced. the modern definition of addiction is this whole concept of nicotine changes to the brain, and the up-regulation which dr. tucker acknowledged and recognized but failed to give credit to the way that the surgeon general does, the way that the national cancer institute does, the way the world health organization does. so this concept of choice is important because choice has nothing to do with addiction. choice is not about whether or not the drug -- and that is why i talked to you about this verdict form -- there is nothing about the concept of choice in the verdict form, and there is nothing about the 22 concept of choice in addiction. choice may go to whether or not someone does quit or can quit. and we talked to you early in the case about comparative fault. and we are going to talk to you about comparative fault later. there is a concept in the law that says that, you know, it is not all or nothing, that there is a place for you to say, well sarah duke should have tried harder. she should have. certainly her father -- her son wanted to and her family wanted her to stop and stop earlier, and she should have. and, you know, she continued to smoke, not because she wanted to but because she was addicted. and anybody who is ever met or known a smoker knows that they probably do not want to smoke. we know the statistics. most would quit if they could. many cannot. not just my words but the words of r.j. reynolds tobacco company in their own documents. and again no one came in here to suggest otherwise. so choice has nothing to do with these questions one and two, was she addicted and did it cause the disease. if it comes in at all it comes in later on when we get to the concepts of comparative fault. addiction. remember we heard from dr. cummings what is addiction. it is chronic. it is repeated. it is relapse in the brain disease. it is this constant need to refill the nicotine levels in the body. it is compulsive and it is done 23 despite harm. those are the definitions of addiction. and i think that what you should do is evaluate all the evidence that you have heard over the six or seven days that we have been here and fold it into these definitions and decide for yourself. i can come up here and tell you that she is addicted. that is certainly my job. but ultimately all of this has been presented so that you can make the decision based on the law, based on the information, based on the standards that the experts that came in here and spoke to you about. you heard dr. burns talk about the heaviness of smoking index and the two major factors. smoking every single day 30 to 40 cigarette a day, it is a big deal. it is not, you know, some minor thing, you know. dr. tucker would have you believe that smoking five or six packs a day is the only definition of a really heavy smoker or chain smoking, or that you have to have some maladaptive pattern of behavior that somehow smoking is such a part of your life that you cannot maintain normal social relationships or normal business relationships. i guess by his definition the only type of addictive smokers are, sadly, the homeless people that we see on the streets picking up the butts of cigarettes. i really do not think that is what dsm-iv is about, and certainly not what the surgeon general's about. it is not what all of these health professionals around the 24 world talk about. remember, there is no dispute in this courtroom as a matter of law and a matter of fact that nicotine in cigarettes is addicting. it is not maybe addicting. it is not might be addicting. it is. dr. gentry, who you heard by video, disputes that, despite that being modern science they still sort of live in the dark ages. we saw this effort to distract you. you remember you saw those monopoly cards in which citations were to the '74 and the '84 surgeon general's report about it being a personal choice? that is ancient. that is ancient science. that is the deception that occurred when the tobacco companies, despite being requested to provide documents to the surgeon general, did not. and so in 1988 the surgeon general comes out with the '88 report that says nicotine and cigarettes is addicting. what do they do the next day? they have a counter blast. they say these scare tactics are irresponsible. so citing to ancient concepts of addiction does not carry the day. so definition of addiction, surgeon general reminds us it is powerful, and that it is similar to heroin and cocaine. that is -- those are not words that are expressed lightly, but they are expressed with great thought to convey the power of addiction. dr. cummings of course used the heaviness of smoking 25 index and scored miss sarah duke in the 5-6 range. she smoked early in the morning, she had her pack of cigarettes in her bed, she had her ashtray on her nightstand, she had here ashtray in her bathroom, she had the coffee on the timer and she got up and smoked. there is really nothing -- that is nothing that is unrebutted. so again, i think that we have clear evidence of the addiction. we talked a little bit about the relapse in this issue of choice and cessation and that it is just simply a tiny, tiny fraction of people that are able to quit right off the bat, completely inconsistent with what dr. tucker was paid to tell you. key characteristics. again, dr. cummings went through these primary characteristics: persistent daily use, time to first, amount smoked per day. all those are present in spades. age of initiation. we know from the internal documents, we know from the surgeon general that if you do not get a person hooked by the time they are 24 you never will, as a business matter for the tobacco companies. age of initiation matters. and in the era in which sarah duke started to smoke, the 1940s, born in 1927, everybody smoked. and, yes, there was influence from family; yes, there was influence from doctors; yes, there was influence -- you could smoke in the 26 courtroom. all the way up into the '80s. one of the most heavily smoked areas in american society in those days were emergency rooms. and you heard about the fact that people smoked in public health offices and doctors offices and emergency rooms. so she started early and she smoked her entire life. difficulty refraining from smoking, we know that we saw it. i do not want to repeat that too much. withdrawal symptoms. admittedly not a lot of evidence of that. does it mean it did not happen? i think it goes to the concept there is simply no evidence. it is not one way or another. and certainly to the extent that the r.j. reynolds tobacco company wanted to present any such evidence, they could have brought people in, they could have brought you depositions, they certainly could have deposed and examined as many witnesses as they would have liked. it is not my words that nicotine addiction is powerful. it is. and all of these entities of course point that out. i talked a little bit about dr. tucker and we know how he was challenged on cross-examination and could not stand up for the propositions that he had in terms of the percentage of smokers and how long it takes, the percentages of people that quit, unsupported. you know, comparing dr. tucker and the dsm, the surgeon general report, again it is simply -- it is simply not modern 27 science. now we heard from dr. lloyd. dr. lloyd as we know was the treating doctor. and he is the doctor that knew sarah duke. he is the doctor that had hands on sarah duke. he told you that she was addicted, he told he treated thousands of patients and could count on one hand the number of patients that were not addicted or that quit unaided. dr. lloyd. this is -- now i'm going to get sort of into the second concept here, both in terms of addiction and in terms of disease causation. this a big deal in the case, you know. the defendants spent their entire case on two issues. never dealing with their conduct, only trying to put the blame and responsibility on mrs. sarah duke. so we know what the death certificate says. we know what the medical records say. we know what the doctors that treated her say. they all say that she died of lung cancer. and the defendants r.j. reynolds would have you believe that there is some technical difference in there, that somehow the stroke was unrelated to smoking, the stroke was unrelated to cigarettes, that somehow she would have died on exactly the same day at exactly the same moment had she never had lung cancer, had she never had her lung removed, and she never had those biopsies and she never had the complications. remember dr. amos? he admitted that losing your lung is a risk factor for pneumonia. and there was even 28 inconsistencies between dr. bennett and dr. amos. i mean dr. amos would have put -- i think dr. bennett said he would have put history of lung cancer on the death certificate and dr. amos would have said nothing about lung cancer. these are all opportunistic opinions of spokespersons having been bought and paid for by the tobacco company and they should be given the weight of their source. and that is your job. it is not my job. i believe that they are biased, i believe they are brought -- mr. furr: your honor, excuse me. i hate to object. counsel should not be expressing personal opinions. the court: sustained. mr. lantinberg: but it is for your determination as to their credibility, as to their believability, and as to their probative value in terms of proving whether or not she was in fact a victim of lung cancer and smoking from the lung. we know what the medical records tell us. remember the death certificate that is signed in this case, 1996, by the doctors, carcinoma of the lung is the primary case. and secondary cause is cerebral vascular accident and bone metastasis. and this is important. there is no dispute that she had bone metastasis. it was not talked about a lot. they want to say there is no pathology for it. again, the evidence at the time, the radiation therapy 29 that was given to her back was palliative, it worked. it worked. because radiation works on cancer. but she had a death sentence once it metastasized. if they -- when they removed her lung they told her, we got it all. we got it all. there is no micro-cancers that have spread. you got a 30 to forty percent chance of life. but if we do not get it all you have literally a zero percent chance of life. that is what happens with cancer. it is aggressive, it is powerful, it is deadly. and once it metastasizes it metastasizes fast. we know that 27 days after her first x-ray came back clear following her lung removal there is metastasis in the spine. it spread. the spinal column is connected to the brain as we know. it metastasized. the evidence may be, you know, imperfect, if you will. it is not csi. we do not have the autopsy of the brain. not required. we do not have the image that shows that little micro-cancer in the brain. but the preponderance of the evidence, the doctors that were there, the neurologists that treated her, the pulmonologists that treated her, those that took care of her, said it was lung cancer. and even dr. lloyd who had the chance to -- he came back, was asked questions about this confirmed lung cancer, and that -- whether he flipped it or not, whether lung cancer as a secondary cause or cerebrovascular accident as the first cause, lung cancer in toto played a role in that 30 death. and that is certainly the evidence from all of the scientists as doctors that have come into this case. all right. so we know what the medical record says. long term prognosis is uncertain but probably poor. and it is signed by dr. lloyd. all right. so dr. burns told us that the tumor was large, it was greater than 3 centimeters in her lungs, and that there was a more likely than not chance that it would metastasize. that is the preponderance of the evidence. we know about the percentages of survival. that percentage of survival, the inverse is that it metastasized. sixty to 75 percent of the patients do not live because it metastasizes. more likely than not. preponderance of evidence. and we know there is a zero percent chance of survival once that bone cancer had spread, or that the lung cancer had spread to the bone. all right. causation. this is -- the judge is going to read you the jury instruction on causation. causation is an important legal as well as sort of a human concept. in this case, you know, the causation issue is the nicotine addiction directly and naturally and in continuous sequence to produce or contribute substantially to producing the death. so the medical cause of her lung cancer was smoking, the legal cause of her lung cancer was smoking, and the 31 evidence makes it clear that it also led to her death. and it does not need to occur all by itself. it can occur with other things. and so the debilitated state of her body from losing her lung, the weaknesses that she had, all contributed to her ultimate demise. we heard from dr. amos who came in all the way from california and came up with a number of concepts for -- to explain why he says she died of something else, none of which are reflected in the medical records, and some of which were never even expressed before he came into this courtroom. they were new ideas, new concepts. again, the paid mouthpiece of the r.j. reynolds tobacco company to give you -- to distract you from the facts of the case. again, rely on your memory of the evidence. you will have those medical records. you can look for some these words, see if they appear anywhere. they do not. this concept of some birthmark on her brain; one, on direct examination suggested that is what killed her, and then on cross-examination when mr. nealey asked her some questions -- asked him some questions he made it clear you can only know from an autopsy. so he tells you that it is the medical probability on direct, but then he concedes that you cannot know. that is no evidence. that is the scales of justice again, trying to put evidence there that is not there. the evidence is undeniable what dr. lloyd and the 32 medical records reflect. dr. lloyd linked the cancer to the stroke, as did dr. burns. there was this issue about hyperlipidemia as a potential risk factor, whether she had it, great. he sort of diagnosed it even though it was in the medical records, but it does not matter. it is helpful to the plaintiffs' case, because it is one of those other contributing causes. it acts in combination. the jury instruction tells you that it need not be the only cause. it can act in combination with other causes, including natural causes. natural causes are sarah duke, her body, her weaknesses, those are other natural causes. so if any of these things, if smoking, but for smoking, sarah duke would have lived if but for the smoking. i'm trying get this out here. the concept is that the defendants would have you believe that smoking had nothing to do with her death. and it is simply not the case. the science and the evidence does not support that. and legal -- and legal cause and medical cause all point to the smoking as the cause of death. so we talked about dr. amos, the same things that are risk factors for lung cancer are the same things that are risk factors for stroke. the surgeon general tells us that particularly with respect to risk factors for stroke, they are multiplicative. so if you have hyperlipidemia, and 33 that is a two factor for risk of stroke, and you have smoking then you have a four factor for stroke, if you have another risk factor, then you have an eight factor for -- in terms of the risk factors for stroke. so here we have sort of a diagram -- forgive my artwork, but it is an effort to sort of point out the issues that relate to stroke, the concurring factors that come together to produce stroke. i want to move on a little bit. we are running low on time. so, all right, let us talk about the cigarette itself. remember, one, again i'm going to remind you the defendants, r.j. reynolds, talked nothing about their design defect. they brought no expert, they brought no employee of the tobacco companies to tell you anything we said about the design features of the cigarette were not true. the surgeon general tells us that it had an impact on addiction and disease and that it was powerful. so this graphic here is meant to remind us of this cigarette that we saw, and you will have the cigarette. there was a bag here earlier with the cigarette in it. and you will have that you can look at the different pieces and look at the vent holes. we talked about additives. the cigarettes were made to be addictive. they added constituents, they added flavors, they added chemicals, they studied and understood and 34 adjusted ph in a way that would maximize the impact, maximize of intake, maximize the inhalation. here the surgeon general is reminding us, confirming for us the power of these ventilation holes and what they did. they produced higher levels of free base nicotine. we talked about how they attached, how important nicotine is. the internal documents. again, unrebutted. i'm not making this stuff up. this is unrebutted evidence. no one came in here to say that these things did not happen and they were not studied. and the surgeon general confirms it. smoother, cooler smoke, diluted, initiation, and inhalation, both of which were designed in the product, because happily for them nicotine and cigarettes habituating and the more that they sell, the more profits they make, they need a bigger bag of money to take it to the bank. important. this is the tobacco industry documents. we talked about the internal documents that were formerly secret and made public. and the surgeon general confirms how important they were and their impact they had in creating the health reassurance. we had sort of a chronology, the time line. and then we have the health scare of the '50s, the introduction of filters including the winston in the '50s. we know we have this scientific concept in the '70s that if we can reduce tar and increase nicotine, more people 35 will smoke what we would call those light cigarettes. and internally they knew what would happen is people would compensate. there is this elasticity built into the cigarette that there is a way to overpower the cigarette. the only design feature between a light cigarette and a filtered cigarette is an extra set of holes. there is nothing different about the rod of tobacco. it is just as engineered, it is just as reconstituted, it is just as blended for nicotine. but if you dilute the air more with the vent holes, then you get less nicotine or less tar was the theory. but they are overpowered. they knew this. if you breathe really fast then those vent holes are overpowered if you draw. and the cigarettes are built for draw, resistance to draw. the filter, the filter composition, the density, they knew it, they understood it, they worked on it. and here's an internal document, all work in this area should be directed towards presuming -- providing consumer reassurance. not my words. their words. and again confirmed by the surgeon general. here we have a document, an internal document. we know it is exhibit 76. in 1972, they have to convince the customer to start smoking with wholly irrational reasons. philip morris, they are using the illusion of filtration as a way of selling their product. you know in the '60s was sort of heyday of science. we are going to the moon, we are going 36 to use science to solve our problems. they knew if they put a filter on it and said, oh, all the bad stuff comes out, it would sell. and it did. you know, the non-filtered cigarettes almost went out of business and the filtered cigarette became 95 percent of the market within just a few short years. the conspiracy leading up to the fraud of the surgeon general report in 1964. internal documents reflect a clear understanding that nicotine is connected with addiction. the modern science that dr. burns testified about. and they kept these results in a very high level of secrecy. they kept them internal. they did not tell the surgeon general. they did not tell the public. this said that the submission to the surgeon general was undesirable and ultimately they did not give them to the surgeon general, and we know this because the millions of documents that were produced in the '90s. again, no one came in here and said what we are telling you about is not true. and here the surgeon general in 2010 is acknowledging the power of those internal documents. and it is not surprising that the tobacco industry, r.j. reynolds, knew what the science of their own product was in the '50s and '60s and '70s. but the surgeon general did and they kept it as a secret. here again, the health -- the changes that were made to 37 the cigarette made the cigarette more addicting. and by making it more addicting they made it more dangerous, a major defect in the product. and again a part of the whole conspiracy in the fraud. these are some of the design features we talked about. the surgeon general is confirming the manipulation of ph, the manipulation of ventilation, the manipulation of blends, filters, ingredients, all of which were for purposes of initiating use and continuing use and increasing inhalation. in 1962, they possess a knowledge of effects of nicotine far more extensive than is in the public literature. and they did not tell the surgeon general. they can genetically determine any level of nicotine they want and they have for decades, and dr. cummings told you about that as well. why? all about profits. it is a business purpose, their sales pattern is positively correlated with nicotine, they sell and they perpetuate that product. we heard from dr. gentry and some of his contrasting ideas relative to the surgeon general report. he does not believe nicotine addiction is a problem. dr. cummings, dr. burns told you it is a public health problem, then they -- r.j. reynolds' position is completely at odds with the modern science, with the surgeon general, with the national cancer institute, and i'll certainly leave it to you to draw those conclusions as to why we know, it is 38 because to admit addiction is a problem would be to admit that their product is defective. eighty, ninety percent of nicotine dependence, we talked about that. dr. gentry disagreed that the modern cigarette is more dangerous. we heard in opening statement, mr. furr tell you that rolling your own is just as dangerous. we have shown you the level of design, of study, of engineering. they have studied every millimeter of the cigarette, every aspect of its ingredients, every additive, every psychological issue about this cigarette so they could make it more profitable for them. reconstituted tobacco is simply a way to use stems and other parts of tobacco to make it more profitable. you heard about this, you know, the surgeon general says that they made it more dangerous. dr. gentry was asked, do not you have a crash program to try to figure out if the surgeon general is right or wrong? his comments were we had a crash program for decades. they have not changed. and this is an important part of the punitive damages aspect. they have to change. and only in a courtroom like this can a message be sent that that conduct is wrong. dr. burns talked about this, about these changes in the smoking. there used to be small cell lung cancer. it was sort of the prevalent cancer from smoking. and then over 39 time adenocarcinoma has taken over, and the belief is that that deep inhalation brings more of the smoke into the lungs and kills those cilia, damages those cells, turns them into callus cells that ultimately turns into cancer is the reason for that. and all of these design features are a part of that. dr. gentry, you know, again on deposition that we played for you, he says, you know, if you are not -- if you are addicted to something without risk it is not an issue. but what do the internal documents tell us? unlike other high risk activities smoking is addictive. how do we reconcile their own internal inconsistencies? i submit to you that there is no way to reconcile it, but that it is a self-serving position taken in the case in order to protect their position. they recognize internally their position on causation is unacceptable. but they maintain for decades that there is nothing about smoking that causes disease. 1953, they have already acknowledged more than 50 years ago, 60 years ago, we know what is in our cigarettes, we know it causes cancer. and there is a document -- and i'll talk about it probably on my second close -- but there is -- the philip morris tobacco company once said if there is anything dangerous in our product we will go out of business. a lie. a public lie meant to create a wholly irrational reason for 40 people to continue to smoke. wholly irrational reasons to smoke. monograph 13. there is no evidence the tobacco companies conducted any research to detect whetter or not what they were doing was actually more safe. so they came out with these health reassurance cigarettes the national cancer institute shows -- you heard about -- i heard this in opening but i never saw any evidence -- billions of dollars have been spent to make safer cigarettes. mr. furr said that in his opening. i have not seen the first bit of evidence to suggest that a dollar was spent, let alone billions of dollars to make the cigarette safer. 1963, nicotine is addictive, at least they are in the business of selling a drug. and here we are, 1964, you know, it should be characterized a habituation, not an addiction. there is a gap in the knowledge. that gap was known internally and ignored and rejected and not submitted to the surgeon general. again, 1967, it is an addictive habit attributable to nicotine. a modern understanding of the nicotine, its impact on the nicotine receptors, the physiological, the physical need for nicotine, fully understood internally. it is a vehicle for the delivery of nicotine. happily for the tobacco industry nicotine is habituating. business purpose. all about the money. 41 emphasize nicotine, the key role in customer satisfaction. the dominant specifications, again, continuing through '64, '70s, '80s, internal documents, nicotine delivery, attractive form. they study this tremendously. 1982, if the exit gate showed we would be out of business overnight. they know a non-addictive cigarette is not a saleable cigarette. and so despite their comments about it being a safe cigarette, despite their comments to the public that what they sell not habituating. they knew that it was the only way they could sell. we talked about compensation. they understood this in the '80s. i'm running a little bit out of time. in '88 we talked about the conspiracy, the counter-blasts, the surgeon general comes out in 1988, 24 years after the '64 surgeon general statement that it is addictive, all the internal documents say that it is, and yet the tobacco institute, the group of tobacco companies, the conspiracy, the agreement to conceal, the agreement to defraud the american public, comes out and says that claims that cigarettes are addictive are irresponsible and scare tactics. how can we reconcile that with the internal documents? i suggest to you that you cannot. as part of this perpetuation of a fraud, and remember, the engle findings tell us that they did this. we brought this evidence to you to support our claim ultimately that we 42 would like you to say that this conduct is so wrong that you should award punitive damages. and you will be asked to put a check mark on the verdict form about that, and we will go about that. you heard, you know i showed you a video of the executives of the tobacco companies raising their hand before congress under oath, 1994, that nicotine is not addictive. a lie. and then here's internal document from the lawyers. the lawyers tell us that the entire matter of addiction is the most, quote, "weapon" a prosecuting attorney can have in his lung cancer case. because they cannot defend smoking is a free choice but also is addictive. now, if you want to talk about free choice, free choice if at all, comes in this case in the allocation of fault and comparative fault. but it has nothing to do with addiction, whether she was addicted or whether it killed her. and this makes it pretty clear i think that that is exactly the point. and the physician described in his document in 1989 is the same strategy that is being employed in this courtroom and the same denials that have been made for decades have been made in this courtroom. winston cigarettes again promoted and advertised millions and millions of dollars were spent to promote the winston cigarettes, barney rubble and fred flintstone in 43 1967. the ftc recognizes the power of the advertising, which is virtually all americans who either or understand the slogan worked. advertising was everywhere. it was the doormats into the gas station, there was the pencil holders, it was in the windows. it was everywhere. billboards. we know in 1979 r.j. reynolds was one of the biggest advertisers in the country, and had half of all billboards sponsored. 1927, youth marketing. why am i talking about youth marketing? youth marking is wrong. it is the kind of conduct that we should not sanction as american -- in america. we should not sell a deadly, addictive product to children. 1927, school days are here, big business, let us go for it. they continue to move forward into the '80s, going after replacement smokes, young smokers. again i told about the statistics about if we do not get a smoker by age 24 we do not get them. this a study of that concept. every younger adult smoker is a critical factor of the growth -- every major brand over 50 years. bad conduct. we should not be going after children. sixty-eight percent of all children smoke by the time they are 18. if they are going to smoke at all they are going to get them by the time they are 18. if they do not get them by 18 they are not going to get them. certainly not going to get them for -- much later than that. 44 1984, talking about strategies and concept segments, attract an early smoker at the earliest opportunity and turn them into a valuable asset. all the smoker was for them was money. and yes this is a case about money. and yes, we are going to ask you to award money. but that is all that miss sarah duke was to them. and in this justice system the only thing i can do in this case is ask you to award money. and it is a hard thing to do. it is a hard concept. you know what, you know, should a smoker admittedly -- i mean i have strong feelings. should a smoker be able to come into a courtroom, you know, and say, you know, i was injured by the cigarettes? some people think that is a bad thing. but i told you at the beginning that the company that makes a product that injuries the customer is responsible. and that is the law. and the jury verdict form deals with that in a very specific way. and the only way to change behavior, and the only way to change behavior in this system is to award money. so we have to ask for it. and so we will. and we wish you to award a fair number. and i'm going get this now, but i'm going to save a little bit of time for my second part of the case. the -- i can tell you that this is a wrongful death case. sarah duke died 15.3 years before her expected date 45 of death. she would probably be alive right about now based on those actuarial tables. and i could tell you that you should award $10 million for sarah duke's death. and no one could say that a human life is not worth $10 million. i do not think you should award $10 million. i think it is a very high number. but it is not my -- unfortunately that is one of the very, very hard things that falls on you, which is to say if i believe that sarah duke was addicted, if i believe that they sold the product intending to addict her, if i believe that the smoking of that cigarette during that addiction killed her, then that is a wrong. that is a wrongful death and compensation should be given. now what that number is, you know, that is ultimately your job. and i think it should be significant, i think it should be more than a million. i do not think it should be 10 million. i think that ultimately we have ask you to say that you want to learn more, you want to know more and you want to understand why punitive damages should be awarded and in what amounts. and we want you to check yes on the verdict form that says, have we demonstrated a reckless disregard for human life? and an intentional sort of mindset that said we are going to sell our product despite the harm to the public. and by putting a check mark -- dr. gentry is one of the top 15 people within the r.j. reynolds tobacco company. he is on the leadership team. we 46 would ask you to send a message that in this courtroom in orlando on this day that is not the kind of conduct that is permissible. it is not the kind of conduct that we sanction. the corporations should not sell products as part of a conspiracy, as part of a fraud over a 50-year period that they know will addict the smoker and will kill them. one in two -- dr. gentry told you this -- one in two of their customer will die of a cigarette related disease. i'm going to reserve some additional time. i'm going to allow counsel for defendants to present. but i thank you for your time, and thank you. mr. latinberg: may it please the court? the court: yes. mr. latinberg: wow. i have a lot of things to go over and a lot of topics to touch on because i do want to 105 respond to a number of items that counsel talked about. but i want to start on this concept of punishment and this concept responsibility. the concept of punitive damages is not a creation of plaintiffs' lawyers. it is a creation of the legislature. it exists in the law to compensate or really to punish and deter corporations from engaging in the kind of conduct that is reprehensible. that is with reckless disregard for human life. and with the -- and the absence of such power of a jury, the eight of you have the power to make a statement. to tell corporations whether it is the r.j. reynolds tobacco company, or any corporation that when you make and sell a product that is defective, that when you make and sell a product that is inherently dangerous, that when you do so with full knowledge that when that product is used and ingested and purchased exactly the way that you intend it to, and that it causes harm injury, illness, sickness, death, that there is a mechanism by which juries have the power to say no. that is not right. and it is not, i think, a logical construct to tell you that everything that happened to sarah duke was the product of her own choice. you only see the word "choice" in the verdict form. you do not see the word "choice" in the concept of addiction. and in terms of choice and responsibility, that choice and responsibility starts with 106 the maker of products. juries establish the standard of care. it is juries that decided that seat belts are required. juries that decided that air bags are necessary. and there is scores of other examples where juries decided what is the standard of care? what is the responsibility of individuals, of corporations, of -- we live in a society in which in order for us to have choices, there have to be rules. in order for us to enjoy the privileges that come with being able to come and go as you wish, to work, to assemble to pray, to enjoy your own backyard in the safety and confines and not be interfered with by others, that comes with rules and responsibilities. and corporations are critically important to our society. in the absence of organized corporations that manufacture and make products for us, you know, it would be impossible for us as a organized society to survive. and the responsibility or the privilege that comes with being able to sell in the masses, and generate millions of dollars of profits, and provide by products, there is a responsibility that what you make and what you sell is safe and done prudently. and the difference in this case is that they knew with eyes wide open for 50 years what they were doing. you know, counsel showed you a number of documents. he showed you 107 this document from niconovum. well, a niconovum product never went to market. they bought it in 2007. where is it? and it had nothing to do with sarah duke. it did not help sarah duke when she was alive. they showed you a slide -- let us see the slide here -- i'll find the slide. but let us -- let us go ahead and move on to an important point, which is this verdict form. 9 mr. latinberg: your honor, if i may use the elmo? and then, we will talk a little bit about that and go over on to the verdict form because, as i said to you ultimately, this is the final work product, if you will, of what you are going to end up with in this case. so the first question is the addiction question. we have talked about it. did they contain nicotine? i think the answer to that is yes. now, the second question is one that counsel focused quite a bit on, and that question really breaks down into two parts. it says, "do you find by a preponderance of evidence?" we talked about the scales, and mrs. duke's addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was a legal cause of her lung cancer. and then, was it a legal cause of her death? so was the smoking and the addiction a legally cause of her death? and i think we have sort of exhausted that. and i may go through with you some of these other notes and point 108 out some of the specific features there. but we know what happened in terms of the smoking, the doctors' testimony about a stroke. and actually, this is -- i would like to focus on this for a second. here, we have the word "cigarettes." we have the word "cigarettes." it does not say winston. it does not say r.j. reynolds. these are the class membership questions. they are without regard to brand and without regard to defendant. and so the only question is whether or not she smoked sufficiently -- smoked cigarettes with sufficient quantity and intensity such that you determine that she was addicted. that is the class membership question. and then once we overcome that requirement by a preponderance of the evidence, and i submit to you that we have, then you get to the next four questions. and these are four questions, these are the engle questions. and if you read the way that reads it says, "do you find by the preponderance of evidence that negligence on the part of the defendant was a legal cause?" in the instructions, the court will tell you r.j. reynolds was negligent. so if this was a car accident case, and i had to show you that the defendant was speeding at the time of the accident, that would be me being required to prove the negligence of the driver. the negligence is 109 already determined. so once we get past the cigarette question, we then get to the defendant question. and that is where we have really unrebutted testimony about what she smoked. there is really no reasonable dispute that she smoked winston cigarettes for most of her life, or that she switched to lights. and there is certainly nothing improper or incorrect about refreshing a witness' recollection about something that they do not remember by showing them pictures. and there is been no inference or suggestion at all that that is improper, and certainly it was fully within the purview of counsel when mrs. duke was examined by deposition to show pictures to refresh her recollection. all right. so we get to this question and these four questions really follow in natural sequence. negligence, the next question is defect. so we have the defect question. we have at negligence question. then, we have the concealment question. and then, we get to the furtherance of the conspiracy question. each of these falls in -- we talked to you about the defect in winston cigarettes. she smoked it. all of the things that they did internally to make the cigarette inhalable, addictable, dangerous, the ph, the additives. all of that, i would submit to you mandates a verdict of yes on each of those four questions. 110 i guess i got the wrong verdict form. sometimes, we have different drafts and we end up with some change. but let me just get the right iteration here and see if we cannot -- the first four questions or the six questions i just showed you are exactly as i have showed you. and then, what i'll do is i'll use the jury instructions that i think i might have the right one here. so then we went through 3, 4, 5, 6, is the -- the sixth question is the agreement to conceal. and agreements to conceal and reliance can take two forms. it can take certainly a form when someone says overtly something that is someone relies on, or they do not say something that they are required to say. as we pointed out before, the fact that r.j. reynolds concealed information is not in dispute. the only question is whether or not you find that the way that mrs. duke acted shows by a preponderance of the evidence that she relied on what they said. she transferred to filtered cigarettes in the '50s when the healthcare became evident. you saw that yourselves in the black and white video of dr. horn in which they are talking about the health scare in the '50s and then they converted to filtered cigarettes, and those became the dominant cigarette in the '50s. and then ultimately, we have a switch over to the light cigarettes in the '70s, and mrs. duke became a loyal customer of the winston brand there. we think that the 111 question here is going to be answered in the affirmative as well. so then, we get to the question of 7, number 7. and this is where if you wish to allocate a fault, if you wish to say the choice comes into this equation, it is here that it comes into the equation. and we do respectfully submit that mrs. duke bears some responsibility. but r.j. reynolds also bears responsibilities, and counsel said that you know, they sort of talked about these documents or these video depositions of dr. cook or dr. gentry. interestingly, and again, i point out they could have been certainly brought those people here to talk to you directly about the documents. there was a reference to this book by silvette, larson haig. do you remember in dr. cook's testimony, he talked about two, two things that i thought were pretty interesting. one, we talked about the ama, and how they had placed dr. haig in a position to infiltrate the ama and provide information back to the tobacco companies. and forestall certain conduct. that is the same dr. haig. and the other is dr. larson, who you heard was basically paid for by a grant to the virginia medical college. and here, counsel brings up this document by larson and silvette and haig as some sort of evidence of good deeds. it is true that the surgeon general in 1964 thanked the 112 tobacco industry for providing what they provided. but a half truth is still a half truth. and in 1964, the tobacco industry withheld, you know, submission of stuff to the surgeon general as undesirable. withheld key documents that reflected their keen -- their keen understanding of the addictive nature of cigarettes and the dangerous properties. and then, so, for the surgeon general to thank them for what they got without knowing what they did not get until the year 2000 is really sort of a misleading suggestion to you as a jury that somehow the surgeon general was satisfied with what they got. they only knew what they knew, and certainly, could not know what they were not told. so this assignment of fault is where you deal with the allocation, and if you wish to assign some percentage of fault to sarah duke and some portion to r.j. reynolds for what they did, this is where that gets done and her honor -- and i submit to you that this is one of those tough things that you as a jury have to do. it is not up to me to tell you how to do that. i could certainly give you my suggestions, but that is all they are. and then next, of course, you will be asked to allocate or award sums of money. and again, as i pointed out, it is the only mechanism we have. you know, is this -- is this millions of dollars a lot of money? sure, it is. but it is the only mechanism that will have any impact on the 113 defendant. and if you say that the defendant did something wrong, if you believe that their conduct was not the right kind of conduct, and the only way to make it meaningful, to give that statement some magnitude is to do it with money. and if there was a different way to do it, perhaps we would ask you to do that. but this is the only mechanism allowed under the law, and that is the way that it is done. so we would ask you to award the expenses to the estate that you have heard about in the $30,000 range, and then certainly, whatever you deem is fair and reasonable. mrs. duke would have survived at least 15 more years according to the mortality tables. she would enjoyed 15 more years of gator games. she would have enjoyed 15 more years with her family and her children, and her grandchildren. and mr. duke would have had an opportunity to have observed that and enjoyed that and watched that. and for that, he has suffered a loss. we then get to these -- these complicated questions of punitive damages and the standard. and mr. furr presented some of those to you. and i do wish to address those a little bit. in response to the health scare of the '50s, they mounted a campaign of doubt and those documents are in evidence, and they have been shown to you. and that is the kind of conduct that i would suggest to you shows a gross and flagrant disregard of human life worth 114 the safety of persons exposed to the effects of such conduct. i cannot imagine a different set of facts that would be more directly connected to this type of standard. the conduct showed an entire lack of care that the defendant must have consciously -- been consciously indifferent to the consequences. other examples were punitive damages are when people get drunk and drive. that is reckless indifference for human life. and here, the internal -- the deep understanding internally of the mechanisms of disease of the product that they made and their deep understanding of addiction, and their deep understanding of how to manipulate both factors, inhalation and addiction, in order to maximize profits is what shows a conscious indifference to the consequences. and so what we would ask you to do there, and you are going to be asked a question. it is a yes/no question. it is not a how much question. it is a yes/no question. do you find that the concept of punitive damages warrants a further proceeding? it will last less than a day, a further proceeding in which you will be presented some additional information from which you can conclude if, and to how much, if any, punitive damages will be awarded. but it is for a different day. it would be more, tomorrow or later in the day, depending on how you do it. but this a yes/no 115 question. this is not a how much question. and then the final question, and it is the final question, it is this question about what is described as a statute of limitations question. you have seen the word may 5, 1990. you have seen that date. we know without a doubt by stipulation and agreement when mrs. duke's lung cancer was diagnosed, it certainly was after may 5, 1990. and then, there has been this discussion about the copd, and some vague references in the record. i think if you go back to your recollection, and you go back to your notes, you will recall that dr. lloyd said he did not diagnose her at all with copd in 1993. what he said was that heavy smokers maybe have these things, but even then, i would suggest to you that the mere diagnosis of copd is not enough to trigger a lawsuit. to trigger a knowledge that someone invaded your rights such as to prime the filing of a claim. there was this inference during the closing that somehow the reaction or the response by the tobacco company to provide light cigarettes was somehow exactly what the surgeon general wanted them to do. and remember, we have shown you the documents internally that reflected a deep understanding of this concept of elasticity and compensation that was not understood by the surgeon general until 2010. and therefore, when the surgeon general made those 116 recommendations, it was making those recommendations on the basis of half truths. and when the full truth came out, those opinions of the earlier '80s were clearly wrong. dr. lloyd, there was some suggestion no one ever said that mrs. duke was addicted. dr. lloyd, the doctor who treated sarah duke, testified in his deposition and testified in the video before this court, she was addicted. this is what doctors do. dr. burns told you that it is the primary care doctors in this country that see, diagnose, and treat smokers with addiction. it is not the $600 an hour psychiatrist, and indeed dr. tucker, told you he does not treat singularly addicted smokers. the bridge, you know, this notion of a bridge, again, i think the bridge is shown clearly between smoking and r.j. reynolds with the winston cigarettes. as for quitting attempts, i think quitting attempts that they come in at all, come into the concept of comparative fault, but the evidence of her quitting is in the record. they were efforts in the -- certainly, in the '90s as we know where she reduced herself down to a quarter pack, and then was in the hospital for a few days and quit. we also know that she tried earlier than that with things like gum, with things like filter tips. we do not have the benefit of mrs. duke here to testify and tell you all the things. we can only tell you what we know. but certainly, it is a reasonable 117 proposition and it is been demonstrated to each of you. there is a lot of documents that you have got. you have got the surgeon general reports. mr. furr told you that there is no singular standard that says what is addiction. and again, i told you that it is for juries to determine what the standard of care and the surgeon general respects and reflects and acknowledges the power and the benefit of the heavy smoking index. all of the factors that dr. cummings testified is both primary and secondary causes are indications of addiction. all of those are clearly embodied in the surgeon general's report, and properly considered, recognized, and used by drs. burns and cummings. mr. furr made some comment about pervasive. that the knowledge with respect to the hazards of cigarette were known. and we told you from day one we were never going to come in here and tell you that she did not know something about the hazards. we also showed you how one, the tobacco companies knew, how they could overcome them. the ftc reports recognized the power of advertising and how, and in essence, all of those warnings were not heeded. and importantly, mrs. sarah duke, that she did begin to smoke in the early '40s. it was not until 1966 that there was any kind of warning, and it really was just a caution until '71. so what we have is a 20-year smoking history, a 20-year addiction before even the first possible warning 118 came out. there was a suggestion that perhaps mr. duke has waited all this time until his retirement to bring this lawsuit. and unfortunately, this lawsuit was started in 1998, and well, it does take a while. mr. furr: objection, your honor. there is no -- there is no such evidence. 9 mr. latinberg: there is such evidence. the court: overruled. mr. latinberg: and that is how long it took. so there has been no sort of purposeful delay in order to -- for that purpose. you know the statistic that keeps getting thrown out -- thrown out there about 60 million quits. you know, if smoking was -- quitting was such a big deal or such an easy thing to do, why do we keep track of it? internally, they know how hard it is. we know it is an addiction. it is not easy to quit, and you all know that simply as a matter of common sense. mr. furr said this was the wrong smoker for this case. the wrong smoker for this case. this is sarah duke's case. sarah duke is the right smoker for this case. sarah duke did everything they wanted her to do. she was the poster child. the poster child for the winston customer, and i'm not sure that i could find a better smoker for this case. 119 the internal documents really were ignored. they were ignored during the case, and they were ignored during the closing. and there was some vague recommendation to things that dr. gentry here said. really, the best that you can take away from dr. gentry and dr. cook is this notion that in the year 2000 -- later than that. the 2010s, they now somehow are a different better tobacco company. that they are changed, that they have this niconovum product that has not come to market. and that they have spent -- and remember, i told you in opening mr. furr said they spent billions of dollars on making a safer cigarette. i challenge you to look to your memory, and look to the record where there is a shred of evidence as to a dime that they spent to make a safer cigarette. they spent billions on marketing, no doubt about it. and they spent billions of dollars on designing their product, but i saw no evidence in this case that they spent anything on making a safer product. so i guess what i'd like to do is, i want to leave you with sort of where i started, and that is that companies that make products that are harmful are responsible. that the only people that can hold a corporations accountable are juries. and that this is -- that the only thing that we want -- any of us want, including r.j. reynolds, is a fair view of the evidence, a fair review of the law, and a fair 120 and just verdict based on the facts. i want to thank you for your time and attention. i know that we have taken you away from your own busy lives. for us, this is our job. but i think that you can see simply by the very room that we are in, the building that we are in, by the formality with which all of this is handled, how incredibly important all of us consider this process, and what you do. so i do thank you, and i appreciate your time, and we would urge you to find for the plaintiff in such ways and amounts as you fair -- you feel -- you deem fair appear and appropriate. thank you.
