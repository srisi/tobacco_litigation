mr. furr: may it please the court, counsel, mr. duke. good morning, ladies and gentlemen. ladies and gentlemen, i think the only possible place i can start this morning is to begin by thanking you for your jury service. we have the greatest justice system in the world. and the jury system is right at the heart of our justice system. serving as a juror is one of the highest civic responsibilities we have in our society. it may be secondary only to serving in our military. why is our system so great? our system is great because our system is fair. it is fair to everyone. if 47 someone thinks they have been wronged they can bring a lawsuit. they can come to court and ask a jury to award them money. but it is fair to both sides because they have to prove their case. they do not get money just because they filed a lawsuit. they have to prove their case. how do they have to prove their case? they have to prove their case with facts, they have to prove their case with evidence, they have to prove their case under the law that the court is going to instruct you on, that i'm going to discuss with you a bit this morning. they cannot prove their case with rhetoric, they cannot prove their case with speculation or guesswork, they cannot prove their case by trying to engender sympathy for one of the parties. they have to prove their case with the evidence, with the facts. ladies and gentlemen, with all due respect, there has been a complete failure of proof in this case. the plaintiffs have made multiple claims and they have proven none of them. and i'm going to spend my time talking about the way that they have failed to prove any of their claims. it is very important at the outset to remember -- you have heard it already -- it is their burden to prove their claims. their claims are not proven unless they produce the evidence and facts to do so. that is the burden they take when they come in here and ask you for money. 48 so what is this case about? let us remind ourselves. this case is about mrs. sarah duke. it is not about all smokers, it is not about other smokers. the class action portion of this case is over. it is now a case where mr. duke gets to try to prove his claims. it is not about the public health. i mean the only witnesses they brought you were public health officials. and i'm going to talk to you about their perspective on things and why it simply does not add up to proof in a case about an individual. it is about sarah duke. and what else is this case about? they did not get to it until the very end but the case is about money. you have now heard that mr. duke is here to ask you to make him a millionaire because his mother smoked cigarettes for decades, despite being warned over and over and over about the dangers without ever trying to quit for decades. that is their claim as to why he should be made a millionaire. now, they have made very specific legal claims in this case. the case is not just a general issue of who is right and who is wrong. he is filed legal claims. he has to prove the specific issues that you are going to see on your verdict form. and he has the burden to do that. but the trouble is he cannot prove his claims because he does not have the evidence. when evidence is missing, when it is not available, that is the plaintiff's problem. not the 49 defendant's problem. because the plaintiffs have to prove their claims. you will see that they cannot prove their claims because the evidence is either missing or the evidence is even -- or the evidence is inconsistent with the claims that they have made here. let us look at the evidence that is missing. what is it that we do not know about mrs. duke? because they cannot meet their burden of proof without their evidence. that is what they have got to produce to you. you know, we do not really know when she started but more importantly, we do not know what brand she started with. we do not know what mrs. duke smoked until 1961 to 1963. that is the first time there is any evidence that she was smoking winston cigarettes. she would have been around 36 years old at that time. if the medical records are accurate with respect to when she began smoking, she would have been smoking somewhere in the range of 15 to 17 years when we do not know whose brand she was smoking. there is no evidence that she was smoking r.j. reynolds' brand during that time. and that is the plaintiff's problem. because they have the burden of proof. but they are asking you to blame r.j. reynolds for everything. and you have to decide whether that is right, whether they met their burden of proof. not only do we not 50 know a lot of the evidence, not only do the plaintiff not have the evidence, like i said, a lot of the evidence is inconsistent with their claims. what do we know we know? we know that mrs. duke was warned about the dangers of smoking the entire time she smoked. she was warned by the public health community, she was warned by the media, we know she was warned by her family, she was warned by her doctors. and of course we did not talk a lot about this, but from 1966 on she was warned by every package of cigarettes that she picked up that had a warning label on the side of packs. from 1971 on, every advertisement she saw had a warning label in the advertisement. and she had very powerful personal warnings that we are going to talk about. but you all know the evidence. you know that her doctors and family gave her very powerful personal warnings. what else do we know? we know that despite those warnings that she did not make a single serious quit attempt before 1996. that is a very important fact that relates to a number of the issues that i'm going to discuss as we go along. finally we know when she was diagnosed with lung cancer and her surgeon refused to operate on her unless she quit, what did she do? put them down, quit, cold turkey, no 51 withdrawal symptoms, and never picked them up again because for the first time in her life she chose to stop smoking. now we also know that the plaintiff has admitted that her failure to try harder, that her failure to quit sooner with a legal cause of her own death. you heard counsel make that admission this morning during his closing argument. ladies and gentlemen, this is just the wrong smoker for this type of case. this is not a case about a smoker who did not know that smoking was dangerous. it is not a case about a smoker who tried over and over and over and made some serious quit attempts and was simply unable to quit. this is a case about a woman who chose to smoke for decades without trying to quit despite being warned and begged by her family members to quit and despite watching her husband die, what mr. duke described to us as a terrible death caused by lung cancers related to smoking, and yet she never even tried to quit. that is the type of plaintiff that we have in this case. okay. i'm going to move to talking to you a little bit more about some other issues in the case. and i'm going to organize my closing around the verdict form. and i'm going to start with an issue that plaintiff's counsel did not even discuss with you for one second during his closing argument. and there is a good reason that he did not discuss it with you, because there is only one possible answer to the issue 52 that i'm about to discuss. it is going to be the last question on your verdict form. i believe it is question 10. it relates to something called the statute of limitations. and here's the instruction that you are going to get: in this case -- it will be on page 21 of your instructions, by the way, page 21. in this case, plaintiff's suit would be barred, barred if mrs. duke knew or by the exercise of reasonable care should have known before may 5, 1990, that she had been injured and that there was a reasonable possibility that the injury was caused by cigarette smoking. defendant does not need to prove that mrs. duke was actually diagnosed with a smoking related injury before may 5, 1990, to prevail on this defense. for purposes of this defense, the critical event is not when a disease or medical condition was actually diagnosed by a physician, but when the disease or medical condition first manifested itself. mrs. duke knew or should have known that there was a reasonable possibility an injury was caused by cigarette smoking if the injury manifested itself to her in a way that supplied some evidence of a causal relationship to cigarette smoking. okay. what is this all about? it is a statute of limitations defense. this is not some technicality. this 53 is a rule of law. the purpose of this rule of law is so that claims have to be filed timely. why do we want claims to be filed on time? because when claims are not filed on time the evidence gets lost. and that is not fair to any of the parties. and that is exactly what happened in this case. the evidence has been lost. so you see the instruction, a lot of words there, so let me try to sort of unpack that instruction a little bit. and you will get an opportunity and i encourage you to spend time looking at page 21 on your instructions when you get to them. but what you will see is that the question becomes this when you sort of parse through it all: before may 5, 1990, did mrs. duke have some evidence that she had a medical condition for which there a reasonable possibility that it was caused by smoking? that is the question you have to answer on verdict form question 10. and, ladies and gentlemen, it was not discussed because there is only one possible answer. and you know that already. this is the august 28, 1980 medical record from dr. lloyd. mrs. duke is a 54year-old white female who comes in to establish with a local physician. sarah has no significant medical complaints until recently when she began to have fullness in what she felt was congestion through her chest region with mildly increased shortness of breath, although this problem has been present for the past year or 54 so. she had no significant chest pain, per se, except for the pressure and fullness in her chest region. she had no other medical complaints. she has been followed in the past by dr. andrews, and her only real problem has been that of significant smoking where she smokes one to two packs of cigarettes per day. so what happens? she comes to her doctor complaining of shortness of breath. as the medical record reflects, she had been having problems with her breathing for about a year or so and she would been seeing dr. andrews for that. then what happens? look at the diagnosis. probable early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute bronchitis. and what does dr. lloyd prescribe to treat that? number 2. begin stopping smoking. attempting to come from two packs of cigarettes per day to none over a six week period of time. so think about how that applies to the facts in this case. did she have a medical condition? yes, she had shortness of breath. the doctor did not have to tell her that. it was something that she experienced and which led her to come and see dr. lloyd. did she have some evidence that the shortness of breath was related to smoking? dr. lloyd tells her, what you need to do, sarah, to improve your health is to stop smoking. did she have that problem before may 5, 1990? this is 55 a medical record from august 28, 1980. she had it 10 years before the time of may 5, 1990. it is inconceivable that she did not know that she was experiencing a medical condition that she believed was related to smoking 10 years before the statute of limitations. but we have more evidence than that, because the witnesses in this case all told you the same thing. this is why this issue was ignored by plaintiffs. all the evidence points in one direction. there is only one possible answer. we talked about she subjectively recognized her symptoms, her shortness of breath. that is why she came to the doctor. dr. lloyd, based on her symptoms and smoking history he diagnosed her with early chronic copd and he told her to quit to improve her breathing problems. that is what you will recall he told you during his deposition. then -- this is probably why they did not address this on closing statement -- their own witness, dr. cummings, came here and told you that based on the 1980 medical record mrs. duke continued smoking cigarettes despite knowledge they were harming her. that is their witness. dr. tucker told you yesterday, and he did his dsm-iv analysis, he was balanced, he was fair, he judged the criteria early. we are going talk about that. but what he told you on criteria number 7 in the dsm is that she 56 satisfied that because she smoked despite her knowledge of smoking-related problems in 1980. and even the fact witnesses told you this. everyone knew it. laura duke came here and told you that she was having a smoker's cough and breathing problems more than five years before 1995. so all of the evidence points in one direction. the only possible -- i'm missing verdict question 10. here it is. it is a little bit dangerous when i have control of the clicker. sometimes i go a little fast. but you are going to see on verdict question 10, this question: did mrs. duke know or should she have known in the exercise of reasonable care on or before may 5, 1990, that she had been injured and that there was a reasonable possibility that her injury was caused by cigarette smoking? answer: yes or no. there is only one possible answer. there is no evidence to the contrary. it is an easy question for you. i'm going to turn to discussing class membership. and i'm going to continue discussing with you the questions on the verdict form that you have to answer. it is important to remember why class membership is so important, because unless mrs. duke is a class member, the engle findings do not even come into play. unless mrs. duke is a class member this case is over. if you find -- and you will see the way 57 that your verdict form is structured -- that if she is not a class member that you will be required to answer no to that question, and then the case is over. so i'm going to start with what she has to prove to be a class member in this case. and the first thing i want to remind you of is that this is a wrongful death case. it is not a personal injury case. it is a wrongful death case. so when you look to question 2 on your verdict form, this is what you are going to see: do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that mrs. duke's addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was a legal cause of her lung cancer and death? that is the question you are going to you have to answer. now there is actually two parts to that. one is whether addiction to nicotine was a cause of her death; the second is whether addiction to the nicotine was a legal cause of her lung cancer. i'm going to address them both while i'm talking to you this morning. i'll begin by talking with you about this issue of whether addiction to nicotine caused her death. you heard this morning from plaintiff's counsel that they were quite clear that their theory is that her lung cancer caused her death. i'm missing 9. the next one -- i apologize. so here's the theory. here's the question you are going to have: has plaintiff proved that mrs. duke's 58 death was caused by lung cancer? and i've sort of drawn this little picture here. it is supposed to sort of depict a hurdle. this is one of the things that plaintiffs have to prove to you, that mrs. duke died from her lung cancer. in fact, during opening statement, the plaintiffs told you that the dispute in this case is whether her lung cancer caused her death. so that is the issue we are going to focus on. what was the evidence? mrs. duke died. we know what the evidence is. mrs. duke died from a stroke. it was unrelated to her smoking. now, there was some -- this morning you heard all the witnesses we brought to you characterized disrespectfully as bought and paid for mouthpieces. i hope you will take the time to think about the credibility of the witnesses that we brought to you. there is an issue about stroke in this case. what did we do? we brought to you a board certified neurologist, dr. amos, who is treated thousands of stroke patients in his life. you will have to decide whether or not he looked like a bought and paid for mouthpiece. there is issue about cause of death. who do we bring to you? dr. bennett. he is done thousands of autopsies. he is an expert on cause of death. you heard how he spends his time. you have to decide whether he is a bought and paid for 59 mouthpiece. and we brought to you dr. tucker. he is spent decades trying to help people with addiction-related problems, and they claimed he is a bought and paid for mouthpiece from california. you know, there is a old parable, "people who live in glass houses should not throw stones." they tried to prove their whole case to you through dr. burns, who under their standard -- i will not say this about him -- but under their standard he would be the $2 million man who has been bought and paid for from california. but that is not really the issue in the case. what did they tell you? dr. amos told you that her cause of death was complications due to stroke. aspiration pneumonia. dr. bennett, the only doctor who really backed up, did a forensic analysis of the case, a full analysis looking in hindsight at everything -- remember, this is what he does for a living. he is a cause of death expert. he is a doctor that other doctors consult to help them figure this out. what did he tell you? the death -- there is no evidence that lung cancer was the cause of death. he also agreed that the death was secondary to complications from the stroke. and even dr. lloyd, he told you during his deposition that although when he initially filled out that death 60 certificate he listed lung cancer, he told you that in hindsight knowing now what he should have known then that he would have changed that and he would have put cerebrovascular accident stroke or pneumonia as the primary causes of death. how did the stroke cause -- we did not stop there. how did the stroke cause the death? both dr. amos and bennett explained to you that unfortunately for mrs. duke her stroke caused paralysis in her face and her throat area. the paralysis led to aspiration, which in turn led to her getting food particles and other materials down in her lungs, it caused pneumonia, and the pneumonia caused her death. even dr. lloyd, the treating physician, told us during his deposition that he could not rule out that pneumonia was the primary cause of her death. well, what happened during this case? plaintiffs came into this case telling you that the lung cancer caused the death. the evidence is overwhelmingly clear that the death was caused by stroke. so what did the plaintiffs do? they changed their theory on us in the middle of case. and their theory became that, well, actually, the lung cancer caused the stroke by metastasizing to the lung. that became the new theory of wrongful death. there is only one problem with that. there is no evidence of that. and there is no evidence because 61 mrs. duke's treating physicians very carefully and thoroughly worked her up throughout her treatment to make sure that there was no metastatic disease in the brain, because if there was, they wanted to treat it. you have seen the evidence. there was a ct-mra prior to surgery, they evaluated her during surgery, they looked at pathology after surgery, they did a whole series of ct -- mris and cts, and she never received any radiation in the brain because there was no evidence of metastatic disease in the brain. that is a theory that was developed for this lawsuit. that is not how she was treated. let us look at the medical records before surgery. this is a 2-26-96 operative report in evidence. this is her surgeon describing looking backward as to how she became his surgical patient. she was evaluated with pulmonary function testing, ct scans, mri scans, and there is no evidence for metastatic disease. why is that important? if she had metastatic disease they were not going to operate on her. they would not have subjected her to this surgery for her lung cancer if she had metastatic disease. during surgery, the evaluation never stopped. we get to surgery, here's the pathology report from her actual surgery. what happened as you heard is this: after she was opened up they very carefully examined the lymph nodes 62 surrounding her lung to make sure there was no cancer in those lymph nodes. because if there was, that would mean that the cancer had metastasized, because you heard that the lymph nodes is where the cancer goes first if it spreads to the lung. and again, they would not subject her to this surgery if it had already metastasized. so here you have the 2-28-96 pathology consultation in which the pathologist looked at materials taken from her during surgery, looked lymph node after lymph node after lymph node, and what'd you see? no tumors seen. no tumors seen. no tumors seen. margins free of tumor. there was no tumor outside the lung. but they did not stop there. she subsequently had her strokes, which of course ultimately her cause of death, but they kept evaluating her. they considered this theory the plaintiffs have. could her strokes be caused by spread of lung cancer? to her brain? her doctors wanted to make sure that is not the case. look what dr. lloyd wrote. the mri was performed to rule out, again, again, any potential underlying tumor. it was felt that if tumor could be found she would receive radiation in the area. none was found. thus, dr. mack did not pursue any further radiation therapy on her head. she had good doctors. she was received good treatment. they were careful. they were cautious. they worked this up 63 thoroughly. and no cancer was ever seen in her brain. plaintiffs and witnesses want you to speculate and guess, well, maybe it was there and they just missed it. but the problem is when we cross-examined dr. burns -- remember the plaintiffs have the burden of proof to prove their case by preponderance of evidence -- here's what dr. burns admitted: the preponderance of evidence is that mrs. duke's strokes were caused by a bleed, not metastatic disease. completely defeats this theory of metastatic lung cancer. second, dr. lloyd told me that she did not receive any treatment in her brain because none of the tests showed metastasis. dr. amos told you that -- and so did dr. bennett, that there is simply no evidence that the lung cancer metastasized to the brain. in fact, remember dr. amos even showed you what lung cancer would look like if it metastasized to the brain? he showed you those ct scans where it would be peripheral, where it would be multiple lesions, instead, mrs. duke had a single lesion deep to the brain. and that is not the way lung cancer metastasizes to the brain. again, all the evidence points in one direction. so, what happened next in this case? well, the next theory that the plaintiffs adopted when the metastatic disease theory fell flat because of dr. burns' admissions and because of the medical record, next they said, well, maybe the stroke was caused by smoking directly. first of 64 all, you are going see on your verdict form that is not the question you are here to answer. the question you are here to answer is whether the lung cancer caused the stroke. but nonetheless, i'm going to go ahead and address that issue. because it is very important and very revealing. despite this new theory, not a single medical witness testified that mrs. duke's strokes were caused by smoking. you know, there is no dispute in this case that smoking can cause strokes. dr. amos told you that. dr. burns told you that. that is not the issue you are here to decide. you are her to decides mrs. duke's case. and not a single medical witness took the stand, raised their hand, and told you that to a reasonable degree of medical probability that mrs. duke's death -- excuse me, mrs. duke's stroke was caused by smoking. there is no such evidence in the case. yet in general it can, but nobody said it did cause hers. instead what they talked about was her other risk factors. you just heard plaintiff's counsel admit this morning could have been a cause for stroke. what is the leading risk factor? her age. as we age, this is just one of things that we become at risk for. her high cholesterol -- this morning it sounded as though it was being challenged as to whether she a hyperlipidemia. you might recall that during dr. lloyd's deposition when he was shown the medical records showing that she had a triglycerides level of 570, that he 65 whistled and said, wow, that is sure something that should be treated. dr. burns, dr. amos also agreed that alcohol abuse -- that alcohol abuse increases someone's risk of developing a stroke. by the way, we did not discuss alcohol to try to do any type of character assassination or anything else on mrs. duke. i hope you believe we have been totally respectful of her. we have had nothing negative to say about her, including the choices that she made about her life. it is her life. she gets to decide how to live. but we had talk to you about this alcohol abuse because the alcohol abuse greatly increased her risk of stroke. finally her hypertension. so she had multiple, multiple risk factors that could have explained her stroke. although we do not have to explain to you what her stroke was. it is not even on the verdict form. i'm simply addressing this to round out your understanding of the medical case here. so i would suggest to you there is simply no evidence that the lung cancer caused her death. and when you get to verdict question number 2, i know i'm skipping around a little bit. i hope this order will be helpful to you as you reason through the case. when you get to verdict question 2, do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that mrs. duke's addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was 66 a legal cause of her lung cancer and death, that the answer will be no, because she does not die from lung cancer. there is more. there is more they have to proof to establish class membership. one of the next -- because the next thing they have to prove is that mrs. duke was a nicotine addict. you have heard that. they have to prove that she was addicted to nicotine. again, i would depict it this way because it is their burden to prove that she was addicted. they cannot do it with assumptions or rhetoric. they have to offer you evidence to prove she was addicted. now, the jury instructions that you are going to receive do not contain a definition of addiction. you-all get to decide what standard of addiction to use in this case. but we would submit to you that before someone comes to federal court and makes a claim for millions of dollars that they should at least establish that under medical diagnostic criteria that they are addicted. they should not come in here with some watered-down definition that really amounts to only that i smoked every day, and try to establish a claim in federal court for millions of dollars. they should come to you and prove to you that she was medically addicted. so that is what i'm going to talk about. dr. tucker came to you and he told you that she was not tormented -- the type of tormented smoker that he sees that has nicotine addiction problems. and, you know, the facts 67 are really -- again, they are all aligned in one way. she never complained about her smoking, she never told anyone she was addicted. during her lifetime never -- no doctor ever told her she was addicted. you are not going to see any medical record saying that mrs. duke was addicted. when she chose to quit she quit on her first try cold turkey. no withdrawal symptoms. which is extremely important. every set of criteria you-all saw, the doctors emphasized that when somebody quits an addictive substance they withdrawal from it. everyone knows that from common sense. she had no withdrawal symptoms. by definition she was not addicted. she simply chose to smoke. now, dr. tucker was the only, only addiction specialist that came to this case to talk to you. he was the only witness that came in here and walked you through their analysis using medical diagnostic criteria to evaluate this question of whether she was addicted. now, i'm not going to spend much time on this, but let us be candid about the cross-examination of dr. tucker. it was full of misdirection, gimmicks, tricks. do you remember this whole bit about dr. tucker's testimony that about fifty percent of smokers are addicted? and they kept trying and trying to cross-examine him with the dsm-iv that says that ninety percent of smokers are addicted? and he told them that is 10 years old. that is 10 years old. there are 68 new data. subsequent studies show fifty percent. and then this really illustrates the complete lack of merit of the plaintiffs' claims in this case. they said oh, no, dr. tucker this, is a 2011 edition of the book and it says ninety percent. and he had to explain to us -- we should not have wasted time on issues like this. this was a reprint of the 2010 edition because they needed more copies of the book. that type of gimmickry and trickery is not the way this case should be viewed. mrs. duke's diagnosis as being a nicotine addict was developed solely for purposes of this lawsuit. she never said she thought she was addicted. she never said she felt compelled to smoke. no one ever told her that she was addicted during her life. remember mr. duke's testimony, i would have never said that to my mother; that would be disrespectful. nobody told her she was addicted. her doctors never diagnosed her as addicted during the course of her life. and now here we are -- i'm just going to be candid about this -- here we are 16 years later. when they come here asking you for millions of dollars they want to pin this label of addiction on her and turn her into some weak helpless addict who cannot control their own behavior, 16 years after she died in the interest of convincing you to award them millions of dollars. that is what is going on 69 here. as i said, plaintiffs did not bring you a medical doctor that specializes in treating addiction. and importantly, the witnesses they did bring, dr. cummings and dr. burns, they are public health-oriented doctors. they have a very strong anti-smoking agenda. they have every right to have that agenda. i'm not criticizing them for being anti-smoking. that is perfectly fine. but that is an agenda that goes to the legislature, to congress. it is should not be brought here in the courtroom and used to try to convince you to award millions of dollars. you heard they have both been testifying for decades against tobacco companies. since this issue of expert compensation is a big deal, let me remind you dr. burns is the $2 million man. dr. cummings has testified over 50 times. this was the seventh time this year already. here we are in april. seems like july maybe. but here we are in april and he is already testified seven times against the tobacco companies. this is what he does. now think about when they told you. if there is any doubt that they were here pursuing a public health agenda as opposed to helping you decide this case, dr. burns told you that he thinks that even roll-your-own cigarettes are defective and unreasonably dangerous. dr. cummings told you that his real agenda is he would 70 like to make it illegal to sell cigarettes or to smoke cigarettes. he wants cigarettes banned. and you know what, he has every right to have that view. i'm not criticizing him. but that is not what we are here for. we are here to decide a lawsuit for money. and you should decide based on evidence related to the plaintiff and not some anti-smoking agenda. do you remember, with all due respect, what they did was come in here and repeat over and over and over and over she is addicted, hoping if they said it enough you would believe it. but they did not offer you any analysis of really why she was addicted. the closest they came was to bring you that heaviness of smoking index that dr. cummings testified about. but when i cross-examined him he admitted that that test assumes that everybody is addicted, because if you score zero on that test you are still lowly dependent or addictive. that does not help you-all decide the issue in this case. that is of no help to you whatsoever, if his test indicates that everybody is addicted. you need something real, something substantive. you need a real measuring stick to decide whether she was addicted. and i would submit to you that the only measuring stick you have is dr. tucker's testimony that she was not addicted, using standard medical diagnostic criteria, which is a test that should be demanded before you come in federal 71 court and ask for millions of dollars. ladies and gentleman, when you get to -- this is your first question. i know i'm going in a little different order, like i said, but the very first question on your verdict form will be: do you find from preponderance of the evidence that mrs. duke was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine? the answer to that question is no. that means she is not a class member and that means this is case is over. i suggest to you that that should be the answer to your first question. i'm going to move to the question number 2, which i already answered in part. you remember we talked about how lung cancer did not her death? well, in question 2 of your verdict form they have to prove something else. they have to prove that addition was a legal cause of her lung cancer. so they have to prove to you that addiction was a legal cause of her lung cancer. first it failed, because of course we already discussed, she was not addicted. but second, even if she was addicted, it was her choice to smoke without ever trying to quit, that was the sole, only legal cause of her lung cancer. the only legal cause of her lung cancer. let us think about it this way. well, i should make sure you understand this i guess. on page 10 of your instruction, you are going to get instruction about what 72 legal cause means. in order to prove that addiction to smoking cigarettes containing nicotine was a legal cause of decedent's death the plaintiff's must prove that such addiction directly and in a natural and continuous sequence -- in other words uninterrupted -- produced or contributed substantially to producing such death. so it could be reasonably said that but for the addiction, the death would not have occurred. we already know she was not addicted; we did not know -- we already know that she did not die from lung cancer. but the third way that the plaintiffs have failed to prove class membership is that nicotine addiction was not a legal cause of her lung cancer. i would suggest to you that you think about this issue like this. i mean it is kind of an abstract concept, legal cause of her lung cancer. but i think if you think about it this way, it might be helpful to you as you consider the evidence. did mrs. duke have the ability to quit but choose to continue smoking? i submit to you that if she had the ability to quit but chose to continue then nicotine addiction cannot be a legal cause of her lung cancer. because you cannot have it both ways. you cannot have the ability to quit and say, well, yeah, i know i did not quit when i should have and i knew to, but it was really the addiction. it was really the addiction that caused me to 73 continue smoking until i got lung cancer. you just cannot have it both ways. on the other hand, if plaintiffs have proven to you that nicotine addiction controlled sarah duke and left her no choice, no matter how hard she tried, but to continue smoking until her death, if they prove that to you, they have proven their case to you. but you know that is not what the evidence is about nicotine addiction in general or sarah duke specific. because here's what you know. and there is no dispute about any of these points, none. because we got these points from plaintiffs' experts. one, nicotine addition does not prevent smokers from understanding the risk of smoking. that does not happen, so that does not relieve them of their knowledge that they have gotten from the warnings. two, any brain changes caused by addiction in nicotine does not prevent smokers from quitting. you know, a lot of time was spent discussing these brain changes. how does that help you? you heard that everything we do changes our brain. this experience that you-all are having right now, having to listen to me for an hour and a half is changing your brain in some way or another. i do not want to speculate about what i might be doing to it. but it is changing you brain somehow. everything we do, everything we encounter, every stimulus we encounter changes our brain in 74 some way or another. so that is not helpful because it does not prevent people from quitting. because you heard that 60 million ex-smokers live in the united states right now. according to dr. cummings, all of them would have had these brain changes. did not prevent them from quitting. and in fact, dr. cummings and dr. burns admitted two things. they admitted that any smoker can quit. any smoker can quit. and that -- that includes heavily addicted smokers. now, this issue again entirely defeats plaintiff's theory of legal causation. now i had the drag it out of dr. cummings because he understands the significance of this admission for plaintiff's claims because he is an experienced witness in these types of case, as you have heard. so instead of just admitting to me the answer i was entitled to have, when i asked him, is not it true, sir, that any smoker can quit? he made me run back and forth and grab all his prior testimony and show him over and over and over his prior sworn testimony where he had admitted exactly what i was asking him to tell you all, so that you would have that information to decide this case with. but instead i had drag it out of him by impeaching him with his prior testimony. now, another issue that i can only describe as red herring. dr. tucker told you that ninety percent of smokers who 75 have quit had quit cold turkey. and there was some prolonged effort yesterday to try to impeach that statistic with the dsm. but, in fact, dr. cummings told you the same thing. so why they are throwing those -- releasing these red herrings into the courtroom, i do not know. why would they spend time on trying to disprove a fact from dr. tucker that dr. cummings had already admitted to? but that is what they did. ladies and gentlemen, we would submit to you again, before you come to the courtroom, federal court, and ask for millions of dollars, claiming that you had been injured by addiction, at a minimum the smoker should have tried and tried and tried to quit. that should be a necessary predicate to your finding here. but that is not the evidence in this case. because you know what the evidence is in this case. there is no evidence -- and again, you know, if there is no evidence, that is plaintiff's problem, not our problem, because they have the burden of proof. there is no evidence that mrs. duke tried to quit in the '50s, '60s, '70s -- i actually wrote it twice there -- or 80s. no evidence of her attempting to quit during any of these decades. and then we get to the 1990s and we heard all this discussion about chewing gum, using filters, and this effort to inflate those to a big deal that she was trying to quit, struggling. but 76 mr. duke during his cross-examination admitted to you squarely that even he viewed those as half-hearted quit attempts. why is that important? that is important because dr. burns testified that a real quit attempt requires sincere motivation and that a half-hearted quit attempt is not sincere. it is not sincere. and then of course as we know she quit cold turkey. and she quit the first time she actually tried. the first time she tried, ladies and gentlemen, she could have quit sooner if she decided to. now, let us talk about mrs. duke a little bit more because it is a case about mrs. duke. did she fail to quit earlier because she was a weak and indecisive, passive person who did not have the ability to make decisions and get things done? is that the type of smoker we are dealing with? that might be a different case. but that is not who mrs. duke is. you heard from all the fact witnesses, primarily mr. duke and his wife, mrs. duke was a -- he put polite, a very strong-willed woman, she was decisive, she was intelligent and avid reader, she stayed up on current events, and he told you that no one could push her into doing something she did not want to do, and that she made her own choices about how to live. 77 do you remember him talking to us about how he -- in his own words he pestered, her badgered her and begged her to quit, and she told him, you heard the testimony, she told him, i'll quit when i'm ready to quit. it is my business whether i smoke or not. i'll quit when i'm ready. not because you are asking me to. that is the type of smoker we have here in this case. i just discussed those points. so, let us try to get to bottom line on this. because here's the thing. when plaintiffs come here and try to prove to you, like i said, that nicotine addiction was a legal cause of her lung cancer, they are essentially taking on the burden of proving to you that she was an involuntary smoker. that is what they are claiming, that she was an involuntary smoker that had no choice but to continue to smoke until she developed a smoking related disease. but you know that is not the case. here's what we know. she always had the ability to quit. in fact, plaintiffs have admitted that she was at fault, a legal cause of her own death for not quitting sooner. she told us that smoking was her business, that she would quit when she wanted to quit, not when others wanted her to. she decided how she wanted to live her life. and, you know, i want to be clear. i'm not criticizing mrs. duke in any way. like i said before, she had every right to decide 78 how to live her life. that is what we all get to do in america. but with the privilege of deciding how to live your life comes the responsibility of being responsible for the choices that you make in life about allow to live. ladies and gentlemen, i suggest that when you go to your verdict form, question 2, here's yet another reason why the answer to question 2 should be no. the first reason was that she did not die from lung cancer. the second reason was that addiction to nicotine was not a legal cause of her lung cancer. the only legal cause was her choice to continue smoking without trying to quit even though she had the ability to. you just cannot have it both ways on this question. it is an either/or question. and the answer should be no. okay. i want to move next to this issue that plaintiff's counsel told you we had ignored -- in fact you are going to see that we addressed the conduct issues in this case two ways. number one, dr. gentry and dr. cook testified to you for a combination of about four or five hours by deposition, as painful as it might have been to watch those depositions, that is what happened. and, second, we addressed the conduct in this case through cross-examination, and i'm going to show you how we did that as we go forward. now, remember, in you find her to be class member then 79 the engle findings do come into play. but as court has told you already, and we would instruct you again, the engle findings do not establish that r.j. reynolds is responsible or liable to mrs. duke. you see, the engle jury had a very different job than you do -- did. the engle jury never heard of sarah duke. they did not hear any evidence about her, about her awareness of the dangers, about her smoking behavior, about the choices she made. they did not make any decisions about sarah duke. they made decisions about general principals. your job in this case, if you get to this part of the trial, which obviously we do not you will or should, but if you get here your job is to evaluate whether or not mr. duke has met his burden of proof to build a bridge between the engle findings and mrs. duke's death. in fact, that is what the plaintiff's counsel acknowledged in opening statement. he said we have to build a bridge with evidence and facts between the engle findings and mrs. duke's death. okay. so again, these are the four claims that they have to try to build a bridge for. you are going to see that there are four questions on your verdict form. i'm going to address them altogether, because the evidence related to these four theories of liability is all very overlapping, very similar. i'm going to try to hit for you some of the high points that were established on cross-examination. but 80 the point we need not lose sight of is that on this claim, again, plaintiffs have to prove to you legal causation. again you are going to see on page 12 in this instance in your jury instructions they have to prove to you that but for the wrongful conduct that death or damages would not have occurred. they are going to prove -- try to prove to you that but for r.j. reynolds' conduct, i guess that mrs. duke according to what we heard this morning, would still be alive today. here's the basic claim they made. relates to all the theories. i'll talk more about it. the real claim is that mrs. duke died because of dangers of smoking were not known to her. that is sort of the central premise of all their claims. but you know that is not true. you know that for a variety of reasons. first, dr. burns and cummings told you that the media had been publicizing the dangers of smoking for almost 100 years in this country, and that, in fact, it has been known for centuries that smoking is dangerous and hard to quit. in other words, it is been common knowledge. and i'm not going to spend a lot of time going through this stuff with you. you saw the cross of dr. cummings and burns. the public warnings about the dangerous of smoking have been like an iceberg. and all i can do right now is show you the tip of iceberg. and i'll show you a few things we know 81 would have been relative to mrs. duke. two years before she was born -- two years before she was born reader's digest reported that smoking sometimes causes lung cancer. no secret. no secret. 1952, reader's digest describing the dangers of smoking by saying cancer by the carton. cancer by the carton. again, no secret. you have heard all this about how the message about the dangers of smoking was pervasive. it was everywhere in our society. dr. cummings. and this may have been the critical admission that he made in this whole case. and once again, i had to go get those transcripts out and make him admit this is what he said before, because he did not like to say it because it defeats their claims. but he admitted that everybody had heard and knew that smoking is dangerous in 1954. everybody had heard and knew in 1954. of course you have heard, you know, i do not know why we even spend much time in this case because during opening statement the plaintiffs admitted that they would never deny that mrs. duke knew what was out there, common knowledge was being disseminated publicly. but then they are still trying to convince you that she was injured because she does not know that smoking was dangerous and because it was concealed from her. well, it is a pretty simple common sense proposition you 82 cannot conceal something from somebody if they already know it. dr. cummings admitted that. you cannot conceal something from somebody if they already know it. gainesville sun. she read it every day. the day after the '64 surgeon general's report, front page, above the fold, smoking is principal lung cancer cause. the warning labels. we did not talk about them a whole lot. but once again, how can someone come in here and say that i was injured because i did not know the product was dangerous because it was concealed from me, when the product itself had a warning label on side of the pack every day after 1966. there is no dispute about that. it changed in 1970, as you see, and every day after 1971 this warning was in the advertisements. in the advertisements. and yet they are here asking you for millions of dollars telling you she was injured by concealment of a fact that she already knew. it just defies common sense. once you know something you cannot be injured by somebody hiding a fact. it is too late. you know it. there was much more about the dangers of smoking. i do not have time to go through all this with you, but just a couple of these things were really, really illustrative. you heard about this congressional hearing in 1957 where the surgeon general said we have done an excellent job of warning the public through radio, tv, newspaper. 83 dr. horn, a very powerful -- dr. horn, the head of the office of smoking and health in 1968, you can stand on a rooftop and shout, "smoking is dangerous," at the top of your lungs and you would no be telling anyone anything they did not already know. and dr. burns, 1975, more people know that smoking is dangerous than know the name of the president of united states. the information was everywhere. some people chose to quit. as can you see, between 1955 and 1965, 17 million american chose to quit. between '64 and '79, 30 million more american chose to quit. we now have 60 million quitters. the message has been out there. what people do with it is up to them. some continue to smoke. some quit. of course mrs. duke did not have to rely on general information. she had the most personalized powerful warnings you could ever have. in 1975 her husband became ill with cancer. she and her son watched him die over a three year period from cancer that they believe was smoking related. that they believe was smoking related. he quit smoking. she never even makes an attempt to quit smoking, despite watching what they described as a terrible death by her husband. you could not have a more personal powerful warning than that. mr. duke admitted to you that they believed that the lung cancer was caused by smoking in 1975 -- the 1978 84 timeframe. and now they are in here trying to tell you that she died from smoking from lung cancer because she did not know that smoking was dangerous? defies common sense. why is it so important? why is this warning so important? dr. burns told you that had mrs. duke just quit smoking by 1980 that she had would have prevented her cancer. that is why her failure to quit is so important. certainly in the '70s she knew, unequivocally she knew, and she knew lung cancer from her husband's situation. she never even tried to quit. but dr. burns, their expert from california, who knows his statistics pretty well, he does know this, and he admitted the reason he had been pushing people to quit for decades and decades was because when you quit you improve your likelihood of living longer. you decrease your risk. and had she quit in 1980, he admitted she would not have developed lung cancer. a lot of discussion about -- a lot of discussion about statements made by the tobacco company. again the bottom line is, a smoker cannot rely on something they did not see her hear. there is zero evidence that mrs. duke ever heard statements by the tobacco institute or the franks statement or any statements about filtered cigarettes or non-filtered cigarettes or any of that. why did not we bring witnesses to address the company conduct? because the issue is whether 85 or not the company conduct affected mrs. duke. that is the issue in the case. that is the plaintiff's burden. that is the bridge they are trying to build. and they have zero evidence that she ever saw or relied upon anything that the tobacco companies did. advertising. i do not know why we talked about advertising so long. first, it is legal. it is legal to advertise. second, it did not have any influence on mrs. duke. again, there is zero evidence in this case that she said she began smoking because of advertising or that she smoked winston cigarettes because of advertising, or that she smoked filtered cigarettes because of advertising, or that the advertisement somehow convinced her that it was safe to smoke or that filtered cigarettes are safer. there is none of that. there is no evidence that the advertising influenced her in any way. cigarette design. here's what the evidence really is, and that is that tobacco is dangerous and addictive, cigarettes cannot be made safe. cannot be made safe. but dr. cummings did admit that r.j. reynolds worked hard to try to take the carcinogens out of tobacco smoke, but it cannot be done as long as tobacco is burned. dr. cummings also admitted that non-filtered, filtered, full-flavor, light, additive free, cigarettes with additives, they are all dangerous and addictive. those 86 design issues, it is another red herring. they are all dangerous, they are all addictive, and they do not have any influence on whether you can quit or not. no cigarette's different than another. dr. tucker told you yesterday that someone who treats people who -- for addiction problems -- he does not ask what brand you smoke because these design features have nothing to do with quitting smoking. ladies and gentlemen, i'm going to go to the verdict form now. you are going to see questions 3, 4, 5 and 6. if you get to them, these are the questions at which you have to answer the question of whether or not -- whether or not the plaintiffs have met their burden of proof to build a bridge between r.j. reynolds' conduct and mrs. duke's death. submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, the answer should be no to each and every one of these. there is just been a complete failure of proof. the allocation of fault for mrs. duke's death. you heard a lot this morning about the allocation of fault and how, if you get to this point, you are going have an opportunity to compare the fault of the parties and you get to decide how to assign fault. there is a couple things i want to mention to you. first, the most important thing to remember is that plaintiff admitted that mrs. duke's conduct was a legal cause of her own lung cancer and death. let us unpack that a 87 little bit. i mean, what can that mean? what underlies that? what is absolutely logically necessary for this to be the case? first, that she -- what would you have to know before you admit it that your plaintiff was a legal cause of her own death? you would have to admit that they knew that smoking was dangerous. how can you be a cause of your own death if you did not know? second, you have to admit that they had the ability to quit smoking. you know when they stand up here and say she should have tried harder, she should have quit sooner, that is an acknowledgement that she could have quit. you would not say those things if you did not admit that she could quit. finally, she had to have the ability to quit smoking at a time that would have prevented her lung cancer. all those things are absolutely necessary before you could ever make the admission that she was at fault. and again, why is it so important? dr. burns told you that had she quit in 1980 or sooner, she would have prevented her own lung cancer death. she would have prevented her own lung cancer death. dr. burns and dr. cummings concede -- now if you get to this comparative fault issue, it is very important to remember what their witnesses conceded. they both conceded that smokers are fully -- fully, not partially -- fully 89 consequence. that is fully in control of the smoker. the smoker is one hundred percent responsible for that choice. damages. you heard the plaintiffs are going to ask you for -- they are asking for millions of dollars. i'm not going to say much more about this except to say when you see your instructions, you will see that any damages awarded must be just and reasonable in light of the evidence. i will also point out to you that the plaintiff is not asking for damages related to pain and suffering of mrs. duke. you will see that is not one of things you are being asked to award damages for. you are being asked to award damages for their out-of-pocket funeral expenses, which was $30,000, and for mr. duke's injury that he suffered or he is claiming to have suffered by virtue of his mother's death. that is what you are asking for to mr. duke's injury, not his mother's injury. that is not -- that is not the measure to damages in this case, as your instructions will make clear to you. finally, the only potentially recoverable damages are actual damages suffered by mr. duke as a result of his mother's death. that is a standard that you will see in your instructions. i'm going to say, ladies and gentlemen, just use your common sense. use your common sense. use your common sense when it comes to damages. but i will say this one more time. nobody should be made a millionaire because their 90 mother chose to smoke for decades despite knowing the dangers without being warned. nobody should be made a millionaire for those choices. okay. verdict question 10, the question that -- can you put up question 10 -- verdict question 9. okay. do you find from clear and convincing evidence that punitive damages against the defendants are warranted under the circumstances of this case? now this is the issue that mr. lantinberg spent so much time on, because this is what they are really interested in. because this is where they hope to get many more millions of dollars. first thing i want to point out to you is that there is a different standard under this case -- under this claim. and that is clear and convincing evidence. and i'm going talk to but what that means. second, we need to understand a little bit more about punitive damages, because you have not heard much about punitive damages. punitive damages are damages that are designed to punish and to deter a defendant. but some other things that you need to know are, first of all, punitive damages are not awarded to punish generalized conduct for which you disapprove. that is not your function. you are not here to award punitive damages because you do not like in general the way the companies did business, if you get to this question. 91 instead, as this slide indicates, they can only be awarded for conduct that was a legal cause of mrs. duke's death. we talked over and over about the fact that there was no conduct that was a legal cause of her death, but that is a standard you have to meet. second, punitive damages can only be awarded to mr. duke. they cannot be awarded to any public health organization or some hospital or smoking cessation program or the american cancer institute or anything like that. if you award punitive damage they go to mr. duke. and finally you need to understand that punitive damages are in addition, in addition to damages compensating the plaintiff. so that is what punitive damages are. what do plaintiff's have to show you to prove they are entitled to punitive damages? you did not see this morning. all you heard was the conduct was bad, the conduct was bad, the conduct was bad, you ought to punish it. that is not the test. here's the test that you will see in your instructions. at pages 19 and 20, you will see that to be entitled to punitive damages, the plaintiffs have to prove that the defendants acted with reckless disregard of human life, or that their conduct showed an entire lack of care, or that their conduct recklessly disregarded the safety and welfare of the public, or that there was equivalent to the 92 intentional violation of his rights. so that is the standard. again, that is the yardstick you use to measure. it is not this generalized test that was suggested to you this morning. i want to go back to the burden of proof because this a really important. you know, think about this, ladies and gentlemen. a request for punitive damages is an extraordinary claim. because mr. duke is here saying i want you to award me money unrelated over and above what i lost. even if you fully compensate me, i want more money. i want you to give me money to punish them. that is what he is here asking you to do. that is an extraordinary claim. as a result, there is a very, very high burden of proof that he has to meet. you will see on page 20 of your instructions, that in contrast, clear and convincing evidence -- which i just showed you is their burden of proof -- is evidence that is more compelling and persuasive. it is evidence that is precise, explicit, lacking in confusion, and such weight that produces a firm belief or conviction without hesitation about the matter at issue. without hesitation. in other words, when you get back there you will be deliberating. if you hesitate, if the evidence is confusing, if you cannot decide whether or not punitive damages are entitled, you by definition have decided that 93 punitive damages should not be awarded in this case. the court: mr. furr, we need to take a brief break. 5 7 mr. furr: thank you very much. the court: someone needs to go to the restroom. mr. furr: thank you. (recess) the deputy clerk: plaintiff's counsel, i have marked on the exhibit list that -- the court: i just got a note that somebody needed a bathroom break. mr. furr: everybody did. the court: well, yeah. it is just kind of hard to figure out when to do it without interrupting somebody. mr. nealey: i had a closing argument in a trial one time. and in the middle of the defendant's closing argument, a juror was trying to read something. she stood up and said "your honor, i have to go to the bathroom now." the court: well, at least we got a note. mr. nealey: it was commotion. (jury present -- 11:21 a.m.) the court: go ahead, mr. furr. mr. furr: thank you, your honor. okay. ladies and gentlemen, the home stretch. we are going to finish closing before lunch, and then the case is 94 going to be yours. the issue i'm now addressing is this extraordinary claim that plaintiffs have made where they are asking you to award them more money, even though they have already asked you for millions of dollars already. we talked about how they have a very high burden of proof of clear and convincing evidence, and that they have to demonstrate those very specific standards that i showed you on the jury instructions i will not go back to now. but you saw them on pages 19 and 20 of your jury instructions. well, let us talk about what the evidence is. this is a little hard to piece together for you because most of the evidence that i'm about to talk to you about came in through three sources. number one was dr. cook's testimony. you might recall dr. cook was the very first witness in this case. the gentleman with the british accent, the scientist at r.j. reynolds, that they played you the video deposition of. this evidence also came in in part through dr. gentry's testimony, who was the last witness that you saw whose videotape they again played, and part of this evidence came in through the cross-examination of dr. cummings. in the interest of time, i'm not going to sort through exactly who said what. i represent to you that if you consult your notes, you will see that this information came in through their testimony. the first issue we are talking 95 about whether r.j. reynolds should be punished because they have had a complete lack of care, a complete disregard for public health. well, here is the story that dr. cook told you. dr. cook told you that r.j. reynolds, brand williamson, and american, and other tobacco companies funded three researchers at the university of virginia commonwealth named larson haines tobacco,and that these three individuals put together a publication that reviewed 6,000 articles from 12,000 journals, and that it was provided to the surgeon general when they prepared the 1964 report. you keep hearing -- you keep hearing that the tobacco companies did not provide information to the surgeon general. in fact, dr. cook told you what the tobacco companies did. they funded these researchers to put together the whole world's literature about the dangers of smoking and provide it to the surgeon general. and they continued doing so as dr. cook told you, after the surgeon general's report came out, tobacco companies did not say, well, that was pretty bad idea. the surgeon general's report was very adverse to us. instead, they continued funding this process so that the information could be put together and public health scientists and anybody else who wanted to read this could find it. 96 again, you keep hearing that the tobacco companies did not provide documents to the surgeon general. this is in evidence. if you chose to look at this document in evidence on page ix in the introduction of the surgeon general's report, here is what the surgeon general said: "the committee, however, does acknowledge with gratitude and deep appreciation and with sincere apologies to any individual inadvertently that the substantial cooperation and assistance of the following: brown and williamson tobacco corp., the p. lorillard company, philip morris inc., and the r.j. reynolds tobacco company. so whenever you hear that these companies did not cooperate, and would not provide information to the surgeon general, right there is a surgeon general's reference itself. and again, they are asking you to punish r.j. reynolds. but the evidence is that, in fact, r.j. reynolds worked to reduce carcinogens in cigarettes. you were told this morning that we did not try to do anything to make cigarettes safer? dr. cummings told you that we worked to reduce cancers in cigarettes. those are the chemicals that cause cancer. dr. cummings and dr. cook also told you that the company implemented design features recommended by the public health community. this design of cigarettes was not 97 going on in a vacuum. the public health community was making recommendations about how you could would change cigarettes to try to make them safer. and when they would make those recommendations, r.j. reynolds and the other companies would try them. in fact, the surgeon general -- you heard this. the surgeon general found that many of the design features implemented by the cigarette companies actually reduced tumor density on average. they changed design feature they put into cigarettes that the public was receiving. and then, they would test those against other cigarettes. the rate of cancer being developed in the animal experiments was going down. and they are telling you that we should be punished for complete absence of care? you know, there is a lot of focus on winston cigarettes. ladies and gentlemen, you heard the evidence. there is -- they want us punished over winston cigarettes? there is zero evidence in this case that winston cigarettes are any more dangerous or more addictive than any other cigarettes. there is simply no such evidence in the case. consult your notes thoroughly. please, i beg you to do that. you will see there is no evidence that winston cigarettes are more dangerous or addictive. they are basically asking you to punish us for selling a legal product called cigarettes that has inherent dangers, including cancer and addiction. that is what they are asking 98 you to do. they are asking you to punish us. they are asking you to second-guess the legislature. they are asking you to second-guess our society's decisions. what is society has decided is this: cigarettes are dangerous. we are going to put warnings labels on them, and adults in a america get to choose. that is our societal choice, and they are asking you to punish us because of the inherent dangers in cigarettes. that is what you are being asked to do. they made a big deal during their case about flavors. but do you remember dr. cummings' testimony? r.j. reynolds reduced the level of flavors between 1954, and in about 1990, reduced level of flavorants in the winston cigarettes by about seventy percent. remember, it was kind of an a ha moment for dr. cummings because he had just made that admission the previous friday in a deposition in yet another tobacco case, and he had forgotten about it over the weekend. and i showed him the transcript and said remember what you said a couple of days ago in your deposition? and he admitted this. and they say entire absence of care and safety? finally, you know there is this testimony about there was a suggestion this morning that we should be punished for some kind of issue related to lights or low tar cigarettes, that we should have never made them. that they advertised them wrong, and that somehow that harmed mrs. duke because 99 remember, reynolds could only be punished even in theory for conduct that harmed mrs. duke, not for general conduct. so the suggestion about lights and low tar, first of all, has to be tied to mrs. duke. but you remember what the evidence really is? mr. duke told you that he never remembers his mother ever smoking winston lights. his wife came in here and said oh, yeah, now that you shown me pictures of the pack, i can tell by the color that that is the cigarettes that my mother-in-law smoked for a while. but then when mr. bassett cross-examined her, she admitted that during her deposition, she had told us that she did not remember the color of the pack. and this memory that she now has appeared only after the plaintiff's lawyers sat with her and showed her advertisements of cigarettes. one of the things you are entitled to do is jurors is decide what you think about the credibility of witnesses. i'm not going to say any more on this topic. that is for you all to decide how credible you think that testimony is. finally, the final point i'm going make on punitive damages is this. again, they want you to find without hesitation that there was a complete absence of care by r.j. reynolds, what could r.j. reynolds do? they cannot make the product safer. there is no way to make it safe. it cannot be done. we have tried and tried. so what do we do? r.j. reynolds' parent company goes 100 out and buys the company called niconovum. niconovum. you remember the cross-examination of dr. cummings and dr. gentry's explanation? niconovum is a company that makes -- that makes smoking cessation products. that makes nicotine replacement products, and you have heard that r.j. reynolds is in the process of trying to get those products introduced in the united states. what more can we do than do the best we can to make them safer. put warnings on the packs, and for people who decide to quit, go to sweden and buy the best smoking cessation product we can find and try to introduce it into the united states to help people who want to quit quit. an entire absence of care and safety, ladies and gentlemen, it is not even close. so when you get to this question, number 9, do you find from clear and convincing evidence that punitive damages again the defendant are warranted under the circumstances of this case, no matter what else you have said in this case, the answer to this question should be no. now, as you received in instructions if you answer this question yes, we will come back and have a second phase of this trial where we will talk about punitive damages, but we should never get in a second phase in this trial. we should never get there for all the reasons i have been talking about. the case should end with class membership. there is no bridge between the plaintiffs evidence and defendant's conduct. there 101 certainly, certainly should not be a punitive damages award in this case. so the answer to this question should be no. i want to wrap up with you, and suggest to you somebody asked me recently what is your defense in this case? i thought i said, they said give it to me in two sentences, three sentences. i said okay. everybody knew that smoking was dangerous. anybody can quit the smoking -- can quit smoking that wants to, and the plaintiffs have admitted that mrs. duke was the legal cause of her own death. use your common sense, ladies and gentlemen. take a step back, from the plaintiff's rhetoric., and all these random documents that are being thrown up here, these ancient documents that have no relationship to mrs. duke, and think about the fundamental nature of this lawsuit. make me a millionaire, even though everybody knew anybody can quit, and i admit my mother caused her own death. here is the fundamental nature of this lawsuit. not only did they admit that everybody knew, they admit that mrs. duke knew that smoking was dangerous. not only did they admit that anybody can quit, the evidence is clear that mrs. duke quit the first time she really tried. not only did the plaintiffs' experts admit that all smokers are responsible for their smoking choices, they admitted that mrs. duke was responsible for her smoking choices. so here we are in 2012, and they are asking you to find 102 that somehow, despite these irrefutable facts, that this is all new, and that you should award millions of dollars. let us take a brief trip back through history about the way these issues have been viewed in our society over time. and we will start with dr. hammond, one of the famous early researchers of the dangers of smoking. and let us look at what he had to say. (whereupon a tape is being played in open court but not transcribed herein.) mr. furr: in 1954, i mean, the parallels are uncanny. and in 1954, people are being warned, and what they then want to do is their business. and what did sarah duke tell her daughter-in-law when they asked her to stop smoking? she said that is my business. that is my business. it is written in there. let us look at the coverage of the 1964 surgeon general's report. you will see the same basic message. (whereupon, tape is being played in open court, but not transcribed herein.) mr. furr: so it sounds familiar, does not it? once again, it is been known for 50 years that smoking is dangerous, but in america, people get to make choices. but they have to take responsibility for the choices that they make. let us look at dr. koop.com. do you remember dr. koop, 103 a famous surgeon general who wrote the report that nicotine -- who was responsible for the report in 1988 about smoking addiction. but here is what he also said afterwards. "the choice --you note they mention you this word choice. they keep ridiculing and saying that addiction -- once you are addicted, there no choice. look at what dr. koop said. "the choice to light up is always yours. ultimately, you are the one that has control over your behavior. the cigarette is not going to light itself and jump into your mouth." the cigarette is not going to light itself and jump into your mouth. this is nothing new, ladies and gentlemen. these are not themes or arguments developed by me, or the tobacco companies, or anyone over here. this is the way smoking has always been viewed in our society. ladies and gentlemen, i'm going to finish up with this thought. as i said before, i'm going to say it a little more directly. we live in the greatest country in the world. and maybe the greatest thing about the greatest country in the world is that we get to make choices about how to live. we decide how to live. but the only way that works is that we also must take responsibility for the choices that we make in life. that is how our country works, and that is why our country is so great. that is one of first messages we teach our children when 104 they are young. that is what we tell our loved ones, our spouse. that is what we tell our friends, and we sure hope they live up to it because we want to live approximate a society where people get to make choices, but take responsibility for their choices. that is how this whole thing works in the america. mrs. duke made her choice to smoke. she made her choice to smoke, notwithstanding the fact that she knew that smoking was dangerous. she did not try to quit. that is fine. that is her choice. she gets to make those choices. but now, here we are 2012 with her son, mr. duke. as you heard, he and his wife are on the verge of retirement. and they are asking you to make them millionaires and turn his wife -- excuse me, turn his mother into the victim that she never was during the course of her lifetime. ladies and gentlemen, for all of reasons i have discussed today, i would ask that you return a verdict for r.j. reynolds on all counts in this case. i want to tell you it is been a pleasure working in front of you. and i appreciate your attention. thank you very much. thank you, your honor.
