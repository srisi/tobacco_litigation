mr. cofer: thank you, your honor, may it please the court, counsel, mrs. marchese, ladies and gentlemen of the jury? one of the first things i said was we believe this case comes down to three pretty when did mr. simple straightforward questions. marchese know that smoking is dangerous, who was in control of his decisions to smoke or quit smoking, and did the defendants do something wrong that caused him to smoke, that caused him to get sick? and i told you the evidence would be that he knew for decades that cigarette smoking was dangerous and hard to quit, that he always had the ability to quit smoking whenever he made up his 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:55 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 4042 mind that he truly wanted to quit and was willing to make an effort or efforts to quit, and that nothing that the defendants did or did not do, said or did not say caused him to begin and continue smoking. so let us look at evidence. when did mr. marchese know that smoking is dr. proctor told you that starting in dangerous? 1950, his words, "there was an explosion of research linking cigarette smoking with lung he told you it was widely reported in cancer." the popular press and that it scared people into he told you about an article in quitting smoking. reader's digest in december of 1952 called cancer by the carton. and it is true, there were a number of articles in reader's digest, but dr. proctor told you that this was probably the most important article that reader's digest ever published. told you it was one of the most impactful articles ever published on cigarettes and cancer. he told you that the title of the article itself told everyone that every time that you buy a carton of cigarettes, you are buying a carton of cancer. that was december 1952, sal marchese was 20 years old. he the next year, in december of 1953, dr. 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:56 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 4043 you and what did he say wynder and graham published their famous mouse you heard about that. skin painting studies. saw how it was published in life magazine. so what did dr. proctor tell you about this? he told you that the article was published on december 9, 1953 in cancer research. happened the next day? he said the very next day, the stock market collapsed, tobacco stocks dropped 5 to ten percent in one day, and as a result of this study, people stopped smoking. december 1953. this was years before the patch, this was years before nicotine gum, years before how did zyban or chantix. these smokers beat their addiction? how did they stop? quit cold turkey. they put their cigarettes down and they so how did they stop? proctor told you that throughout the 1950s, there was an enormous amount of media attention on cigarette smoking and cancer. because a very large portion of the population was smoking at the time. cigarette smoking to lung cancer was important information for everyday people. people reading about it and they were talking about it big time. the studies linking why? so how do we know? because in june of 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:57 02:58 02:58 02:58 02:58 02:58 02:58 02:58 02:58 02:58 02:59 02:59 02:59 4044 1954, the gallup company did a nationwide poll where they asked, "have you heard or read anything recently to the effect that cigarette smoking may be a cause of cancer of the lungs?" ninety percent said yes. an incredibly high number in june of 1954. and think about that. that is you heard about edward r. murrow's show you heard that in 1955, he actually see it now. devoted two 1-hour programs to the issue of cigarette smoking and lung cancer. told you that see it now was a more credible version of 60 minutes. dr. proctor i showed you a dr. e. cuyler hammond of the american cancer society and he was interviewed on the show. here's what he said: (video playing.) "good evening. this is see it now, produced by the partnership of friendly and murrow. cigarettes and lung cancer. tonight, the first of two reports on in 1952, drs. hammond and horn of the american cancer society began an extended study of the smoking habits of american men. here is dr. hammond reporting on the results of the first two years. 02:59 02:59 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 4045 it is now established in my opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that cigarette smoking greatly increases the probability of developing lung cancer. the dangers, and they are being warned. then want to do, whether they wish to smoke or not, is their own business." in my opinion, people should be warned of what they (video ended.) that was in 1955 on national television on so, two years later, the head of see it now e. cuyler hammond of the american cancer society. the national cancer institute in 1957, john heller, was asked whether the message was getting out to the american public about the health risks of smoking. "the newspapers, radio, tv and other media have done an excellent job covering this problem, a very objective job." he is what he says: the head of the nci, that same year, surgeon general burney, surgeon general of the united states, was asked whether the message was getting out about the dangers of the smoking. what he did say? "we have informed the public through the excellent coverage of the press, radio and tv." seven years later, in 1964, the surgeon 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:00 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 4046 general of the united states published his landmark report announcing to the world that the cigarettes -- that cigarette smoking was a proven cause of lung cancer. dr. proctor told you it got massive publicity although mrs. marchese told you she does not recall seeing it and she does not recall her husband seeing it. dr. proctor told you that it was on the front page of every major newspaper in this country. cover of national magazines, it was the lead story on all three networks' nightly news, cbs, nbc, abc and we showed you how it published on cbs with harry reasoner. that it was on the (video playing.) "on smoking and health. the findings of almost from the the surgeon general's committee. moment that cigarettes were introduced, they were attacked, but the attacks took a new turn 10 years ago and culminated in today's report by the surgeon general's committee. what the committee says. this, in summary, is cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer in men and data on women smokers points the cigarettes smoking is a significant same way. cause of cancer of the larynx and probably the 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:01 03:02 03:03 03:03 4047 most important cause of chronic bronchitis. cigarette smoking may be related to other lung diseases. male smokers have a much higher death rate from heart disease, although it is not proven that smoking is the cause. filters, the committee says there is no evidence that they do any good, but it did not exclude the possibility that an effective filter might be developed. on the question of in short, the committee says if you smoke cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying the sooner you start, the more you smoke, early. the more you inhale, the worse your chances are. the surgeon general's committee presented its report at a news conference in washington. after its long and exhaustive deliberations, the committee has reached the overall judgment that cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance to the united states to warrant remedial action. overall judgment was supported by many converging lines of evidence as well as by data indicating that cigarette smoking is related to higher death rates in a number of disease categories. this more specifically, the committee states on 03:03 03:03 03:03 03:03 03:03 03:03 03:03 03:03 03:03 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 4048 page 61 of the report, and i quote, 'in view of the continuing and mounting evidence from many sources, it is the judgment of the committee that cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and to the overall death rate.' above all, every american who smokes and an old smoker every american youngster who is thinking of smoking must now consider whether to stop or not it comes down to a subjective question: to start. there is no question but that smoking has meant a great deal to great many people. never forgets how he started, and through the lifetimes of a lot of us, cigarettes have been an intimate and reassuring companion; the familiar slogans, the familiar packages have been a part of our lives. in a friend has all along been betraying you. case like that, you give the old friend every possible chance before you finally decide to believe what you have been told, and maybe even then, you give them a chance to reform. it is like being told that an old in this kind of a country, it comes down to you whether you like it or not. going to forbid an adult to smoke and it is now no one is 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:04 03:05 03:05 03:05 03:05 4049 quite clear that no one is going to tell him it is good for him, either. the decision is his, the decision and the health that may depend on it. this is harry reasoner. (video ended.) so i talked with dr. proctor about the good night." importance of that report and i wrote down what he said and i want to read it to you because i want to get it just right. he said over dr. proctor told you that the 1964 surgeon general's report initiated an unprecedented period of quitting in the united states. the next 15 years, between '64 and '79, 30 million americans quit smoking. dr. proctor told you that the 1964 surgeon general's report was "the turning point on smoking rates in the united states." he said it was the beginning of the end of cigarettes that rarely in social history in this country. can a single event be identified as a key source of social change and that the publication of the 1964 surgeon general's report "marked the beginning of a revolution in the attitudes and behaviors related to cigarettes." 1964, sal marchese was 32 years old. four years later, daniel horn from the american cancer 03:05 03:05 03:05 03:05 03:05 03:05 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 4050 society, you heard that he did the retrospective epidemiological studies with dr. hammond. what did he say in 1968? "you can stand on a rooftop and shout smoking is dangerous at the top of your lungs and you would not be telling anyone anything they did not already know." 1968. beginning in 1960s through the 70s and the 80s, the american cancer society, the american heart association, the american lung association, and other public health groups ran some public service announcements or psas. couple of examples. perry mason show. let me show you a this is bill talman from the (video playing.) "this is the house we live in. this is barbie, looking after her steve, billy; he is pretty handy to have around. home from college. brother, timmy. from high school. susan, our youngest. wife, peggy, who looks after all of us. that is me, bill talman, with a friend of mine you might recognize. debbie, who will soon graduate and my and you know, i did not really mind losing those courtroom battles, but i'm in a battle right now i do not want to lose at all because, if i lose 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:06 03:07 03:07 03:07 03:07 03:07 03:07 03:07 03:07 01:30 01:30 01:30 01:30 01:30 01:30 01:30 01:31 i've got lung cancer. it, it means losing my wife and those kids you just met. so take some advice about smoking and losing from someone who has been doing both for years: smoke, do not start. be a loser." if you do not if you do smoke, quit. do not (video ended.) on direct examination mrs. marchese was asked about some of her favorite actors, some of the movie stars she liked, and one of the ones she mentioned was yul brenner. and she actually said that she remembers seeing this public service announcement back when it was aired. (video playing.) "ladies and gentlemen, the late yul brynner. i really wanted to make a commercial when i discovered that i was that sick and my time was so limited. says simply: i wanted to make a commercial that now that i'm gone, i tell you do not smoke. if i could whatever you do, just do not smoke. take back that smoking, we would not be talking about any cancer. i'm convinced of that." (video ended.) 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 01:31 03:08 03:08 03:08 03:08 03:08 03:08 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:34 01:35 01:35 4052 when mrs. marchese saw that commercial, is there any doubt that this point she understood that smoking could cause lung cancer and death. members of the jury, this was information available not just to sal marchese, it was available to all americans, smokers and nonsmokers alike. it was up to every person to decide what they were going to do with the information they had, but since this case is about sal marchese, let us talk about what he knew. let us talk about the evidence that is specific and personal to him. i've got a timeline here, i've got a we he, too, was a heavy mr. marchese's father timeline here if that is easier for you to see. know that in 1961, mr. marchese got a very personal warning about the dangers of smoking. his dad had a heart attack. was a heavy smoker and mrs. marchese testified that at the time mr. marchese's dad had a heart attack, both she and mr. marchese suspected that it may have been caused by cigarette smoking. 1961. four years later, in 1965, her dad was diagnosed with emphysema. smoker and mrs. marchese told you that his doctors told her in 1965 that her dad's emphysema was caused by smoking. this is one of the diseases in 03:09 03:09 03:09 03:09 03:09 03:09 03:09 03:09 03:09 03:10 03:10 03:10 03:10 4053 this case that they are asking you to award damages for. the next year, mr. marchese's dad died from a stroke that both mr. and mrs. marchese attributed to smoking. seven years later, in 1973, mrs. marchese her doctors was diagnosed with breast cancer. told her that it could be related to her smoking and she told you she and they urged her to quit. got that news, she was terrified. she had three small children to take care of. she did not want to risk a recurrence of her cancer, so she made a decision to quit and she made a plan and she stuck with it and she persevered. it was a taper method that took her six months to do it. in closing argument, i believe mr. pendell said trudy told you that she and sal did not discuss her breast cancer and smoking. marchese said she told mr. marchese that she was going to quit and why she was going to quit. and do you remember what her husband said? whatever you want to do. well, mrs. do mrs. marchese also said that mr. marchese did not try to quit and she respected his decision. so '61, '65, '66, '72, mr. but think about that. 03:10 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:11 03:12 03:12 03:12 03:12 03:12 03:12 03:12 03:12 03:12 03:12 4054 marchese sees people he loved in his family get sick and his father died from a disease they suspect is caused by smoking. '72, the love of his life, love of his life, or '73, is diagnosed with breast cancer and quit smoking. never smokes another cigarette ever again. what more powerful information could a person possibly have? forget the psas, forget the newspaper articles, what more powerful, impactful information could a person have that cigarette smoking is dangerous, can cause disease and death and can be very hard to quit? this was information that mr. marchese had the evidence is so i started my in the 1960s, in the 1970s. closing argument by asking this question: when did mr. marchese know that smoking is dangerous? what was the evidence? overwhelming starting in 1950s, when mr. marchese was in his 20s, he was on notice that smoking is dangerous can cause cancer. throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the evidence linking cigarette smoking and lung cancer got stronger. by the early 1960s, the idea that smoking can be dangerous was no longer an abstract concept, it was not something that happened to someone else, it was something 03:12 03:12 03:12 03:12 03:12 03:13 03:13 03:13 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 4055 that was happening to people who were very, very close to him in his life. 1966, his dad dies. what else happens? the first warning went on the cigarette pack. january 1, 1966. you remember, i think it was during dr. proctor, they put up a chart about how many cigarettes did mr. marchese smoked in his life, i thought had he stopped smoking in 1966, how many of those would he have avoid? had he stopped in 1973 or '74 with his wife, how many would he have avoided? four years later, the after january 1, 1966, mr. marchese never smoked a single cigarette that did not come from a pack with a warning. warning was -- this time, the warning said, "the surgeon general has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health." warning was on every pack of cigarettes sold in this country for 15 years. this 1985, the warning is changed. now, look what the warning says in 1985. "smoking causes lung cancer," the disease that he would die from 29 years later, "emphysema," it is a form of copd, the plaintiff has sued in this case to recover for, but what is really important, "quitting 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:14 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 4056 smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to health." in this case, plaintiff claims that mr. marchese did not have the information he needed to make an informed decision to quit. information could he have had? could anyone have told him? really, what more what more mr. pendell said something to open his in many closing argument, same thing mr. oliver said in his opening statement that i agree with. respects, this case is about opportunity, it is mr. about choice, and it is about responsibility. marchese had the opportunity to avoid continuing to smoke, he made a choice to continue to smoke, and, ultimately, you have to decide whether he has responsibility for those choices. by 1974, he knew and understood that smoking was dangerous and could be hard to quit, yet, according to mrs. marchese, he made absolutely no effort whatsoever to quit smoking for decades. no effort whatsoever. and that takes us to question two. none. who was in control of mr. marchese's decision to smoke or quit smoking? you remember i've told you since jury selection that nicotine is addictive and that 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:15 03:16 03:16 03:16 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 4057 i told you that in jury selection, i some people who smoke will, in fact, become addicted. told you that in opening statement, i've told you that consistently throughout this case, but i also told you that it is absolutely undisputed that even addicted smokers can and do quit smoking. every single witness who testified in this case proctor told you that, polsky agrees with that. told you that, werner told you that, kaplan told you that. dr. proctor told you that 60 million between 1 and 2 thousands quit every you heard that tens of millions of those americans have quit smoking. million quit every year. day. smokers had the sort of the brain changes that dr. werner and dr. kaplan talked about. millions of those smokers would have had withdrawal symptoms. released in the brain, but they quit. those smokers had dopamine tens of in the 1950s, 6 out of 10 men in country i think today, it is less than 2. were smokers. proctor said it is like 1 in 7, 15 percent or something. of women smoke. tens of millions of people have quit smoking, tens at its peak, something like forty percent that, too, has dropped in half. 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:17 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 4058 of millions of people have chosen not to start smoking. by the time when the 1990 surgeon you remember general's report, more than half of all living smokers had already quit. the vast majority of those quit without any smoking aids. what dr. werner told you? ninety percent of smokers quit cold turkey. that is not everyone's experience. benefit now from chantix or zyban, from a nicotine replacement therapy, from counseling, but dr. werner, their expert, told you that ninety percent quit cold turkey. she told you that now, some people you do not need an expert to tell you this is common sense, your experience every day in your lives, the single most important factor in determining whether someone is able to successfully quit smoking is motivation and persistence. simply put, unless and until the smoker makes up his or her mind that they truly want to quit, they are not going to quit. and i want you to think that is not unique to smoking. about your own lives, all of your own lives. you know, if we do not work at something, it is probably we can talk about it, but if not going to happen. 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:18 03:19 03:19 4059 we do not do something, if we do not make an effort, we are probably not going to be successful. so it begs the question did mr. marchese did he make a sincere effort so let us talk about that. really want to quit? or efforts to quit? mrs. marchese, his wife, his best friend for 46 years who was with him every day of their life after they got married testified that the very first time that mr. marchese made any attempt, made any effort whatsoever to quit smoking, was sometime after 1993 when they moved from new york to florida. husband made no effort whatsoever in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s. according to mrs. marchese, her now, ms. irwin says she remembers she says she remembers her dad differently. making a couple quit attempts in the 1980s and that is inconsistent with what mrs. marchese remembers, but, regardless, what we know is that he did not try to quit in the 50s, the 60s, or 70s, and maybe if ms. irwin is right, he tried to quit a couple times in the 80s. so how did he try to quit? well, he would just wait a little bit longer how did he try? to smoke a cigarette. maybe he would smoke a 03:20 03:20 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 4060 that is it. cigarette, half of it, and then wait a while and light it again. mrs. marchese estimated that he may have done that eight times in his life. that is it. that is the only method that mr. marchese ever used to try to quit. he never threw away his cigarettes or ashtrays, he never tried any stop smoking aids, he never used it nicotine gum that went on the market in 1984. was over the counter by '96. he never tried the nicotine patch, that went on the market in '92. he did not take any medication to help him quit. he never asked a doctor for help. attended a stop smoking clinic. acupuncture or hypnosis. successfully quit smoking for 20 years before he tried to quit, but he did not ask her advice in he did not use the taper method that was quitting. other than the two months so successful for her. when he was in his car wreck or the week that he was in the hospital for his neck surgery, mr. marchese continued to smoke until the day he died. mrs. marchese has he never he did not try according to mrs. marchese, he never went more than a half hour tops. does that sound to you like someone who was committed to quitting does it sound like someone who really smoking? 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:21 03:22 03:22 03:22 4061 wanted to quit? so, you know, i agree with much of what counsel said, common sense, collective experience, there is nothing that is the judgment of the jury. more powerful than that. we have all heard the old adage, have not we, actions speak louder than words. both drs. werner and kaplan told you that the surgeon general defines a serious quit attempt as not smoking for at least 24 hours. them said that. both of now, we are going to talk more about kaplan and werner's testimony later, it was kind of interesting that they testified basically the same day, overlapped and while they hit different kind of overall conclusions, a lot of what they said was the same. so i'm glad that you had an opportunity to listen to their testimony back-to-back because, frankly, they agreed on lots and lots of things. and one thing they did agree on is that a serious quit attempt is defined as not smoking for at least 24 hours. know? in the hospital, he never went more than an hour mrs. marchese said one-half without a cigarette. and what do we it is undisputed that other than when he was 03:23 03:23 03:23 03:23 03:23 03:23 03:23 03:23 03:23 03:24 03:24 03:24 4062 hour tops. so think about that. according to the surgeon general of the united states, mr. marchese, in his entire life, never made a single serious attempt to quit smoking. wonder that he did not quit? is there any again, back to mr. pendell, opportunity, you know, it is some choice, responsibility. interesting, both sides called experts that say lot of things that you probably already know. it is hard for some people to quit smoking, others are able to put it down pretty easily. people have physical withdrawal symptoms, some do not. others still smoke. you are probably not going to quit. millions of people have successfully quit, if you do not try to quit, but when you ask yourself why mr. marchese it is not one who is paid mr. marchese's treating you remember dr. polsky was the doctor never quit smoking, you know the witness that i suggest you think about? to come, it is dr. polsky. physician. who took care of mr. marchese in the emergency room in may of 2004? he was a doctor that saw him may 5th and then he also saw him when he came back may 13th. and dr. polsky practiced medicine for 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:24 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 4063 dr. polsky told you he is 25 years with dr. norensberg, who was mr. marchese's family doc. been practicing medicine in this community for 40 years, he is told you that he is seen thousands and thousands and thousands of patients. asked him about his experiences with patients who smoked. you remember what dr. polsky told you? he said, well, he offers all of his patients who smoke assistance in quitting and it is up to the patients to decide whether to accept his advice. dr. polsky said if a patient does not want to quit, there is absolutely nothing he can do to make them quit. so i mr. pendell says sal marchese did not have a choice or had no choice about nicotine getting to his brain. well, i think dr. polsky would beg to differ. what dr. polsky said is it is up to the patient to decide whether they want to quit, that a patient has to be motivated and without motivation, it is not even worth trying to get his patients to quit. that was not a witness who has been paid a bunch of money to testify in this case or any engle case. that was plaintiff's own treating he told you doctor. so what did he tell you? 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:25 03:26 03:26 4064 something that you all knew before you came in this courtroom before you heard one bit of evidence. wants to quit, what is the first thing he or she has to do? they have to make up their mind they want to and are going to. no one can do it for you. if a smoker what is the next thing they have to do? i think kaplan and werner told you, most of them have to you heard that from all of the they have to make an effort. make many efforts. experts. typically, it is five to seven times before someone is successful, not always. down, the expert i brought, frazier, told you it takes his patients 12 times. for most people, it takes multiple efforts. so the deal is you have to do three some people put it what everyone agreed things, i want to quit, it is more important for me not to smoke than to smoke, i am willing to make an effort to quit and, hey, you know what, if i fall off the wagon, i'm willing to climb back and try to do it again. committed to quitting, no one can quit for them. but if someone is not so why is that important in this case? because as we all know, every time you go to a doctor what is one of the first questions the 03:27 03:27 03:27 03:27 03:27 03:27 03:27 03:27 03:27 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 4065 do you smoke? and if we say yes, the doctor says and that is been true for a very, doctor asks? what does the doctor tell us? quit smoking. very long time. and why do doctors tell us that? because when smokers quit, the risk of getting a smoking-related disease goes down. earlier they quit and the longer they stay quit, the better off they are. and the i asked dr. proctor about doll and peto's remember, that was famous british doctors study. a study that sir richard doll and sir richard peto actually started in the 1950s, they followed 35,000 british doctors for 50 years and they published results along the way and what they found was that, on average, smokers die about 10 years earlier than nonsmokers, but if you quit smoking, you get some of those years back. what that study showed was if you quit by age 35, you get all 10 years back. causes. smoking causes. 9 years back. avoid the vast majority of excess risk. this is from all everything that if you quit by middle age, you and this is all causes. if you quit by age 45, you get members of the jury, if mr. marchese quit when his dad had a heart attack or died of a 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:28 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:29 4066 stroke, when his father-in-law had emphysema, when his wife developed breast cancer, we would not be here, but he made no effort to quit. you heard this today from dr. frazier and he said small cell lung cancer is a fast also mr. pendell said something about the lung cancer. lung cancer, it happened in a matter of months. dr. frazier told you that in 27 years of practice, he is never had a patient develop small cell lung cancer who quit smoking five years before. think mr. marchese did not get lung cancer, about that. was not diagnosed with lung cancer until 2004. if he had quit as late as 1990s, if you ultimately decide that he was diagnosed, we have talked about this, with copd in 1990s, in 1995, if he reach that decision, had he quit smoking then, more likely than not, he never would have gotten small cell lung cancer. in 1974, mrs. marchese made the decision to quit smoking, but, unfortunately, her husband made a different decision. and that takes us to question 3. wrong that caused mr. marchese to smoke and get so let us just talk about the heart of sick?" plaintiff's case, the conduct of the tobacco "did the defendants do something 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:29 03:30 03:31 03:31 03:31 03:31 4067 companies. well, dr. proctor told you that in 1954, years after mr. marchese already started smoking, the defendants entered into a 50-year conspiracy to deny the health risks of smoking. obviously, no conspiracy caused him to start smoking because he was already smoking. basically, proctor told you that the companies conspired to create doubt about whether smoking causes cancer and disease, and he showed you some clips where spokespeople for the company said we do not know, maybe it does, maybe it does not. he showed you snippets from some documents and he argued, okay, the companies really know it is addictive and causes disease, but they never told the public. but here's the deal: for purposes of this lawsuit, it does not matter whether the companies conspired to hide the health risks unless plaintiff shows that mr. marchese was somehow misled. now, do not get me wrong, i am not asking you to approve of the tobacco companies or their conduct, i'm not asking to like them, i'm not asking you to ignore the evidence, but this is a case that mrs. marchese has brought to recover 03:31 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 4068 money for the death of her husband, and under the law, if the actions of the defendants did not harm mr. marchese, if they did not fool and mislead mr. marchese, then they are not relevant to this case. let me say the evidence is clear that there was not a did you hear a single witness tell nothing the companies said or did influenced or confused mr. marchese in any way. single shred of evidence that mr. marchese ever heard or relied on anything the companies said or did not say. you that mr. marchese was ever confused about the risk of smoking? mr. marchese never told anyone he smoked filters because he thought they were safer. you heard about light cigarettes, mr. marchese never smoked a light cigarette. the evidence is overwhelming and he was not confused. uncontradicted that since 1960s and 1970s, mr. marchese personally understood that smoking caused disease and can be hard to quit. nothing to quit. waiting for the tobacco companies to tell him something he did not already know. he had the information he needed to decide whether to smoke or not smoke and he made a decision. he made a decision to smoke. yet he did he was not 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:32 03:33 03:33 03:33 03:33 so, in light of those facts, what did well, he tried to make when i was in law school, my trial proctor do, dr. proctor? you mad. practice professor used to tell me, hey, walt, if you have got the facts, pound the facts. you have got the law, pound the law. have either, just pound the table and make everybody mad. when if you do not in his understated way, dr. proctor just he told you in his opinion, pounded the table. the companies coopted and conspired with the american medical association, congress, newspapers and magazines, major universities, public health researchers to hide the dangers of the smoking and mislead the american public. but here's the question he never answered: what dangers were hidden? what dangers were dr. hidden and how did that affect mr. marchese? proctor himself admitted that starting in 1950s, there was wide and growing knowledge that smoking was dangerous, causes cancer and it is hard to yet it is true that no one had access to the quit. companies' internal business records until 1990s, but did dr. proctor show you a single statement in any of the documents that would have made a 03:33 03:34 03:34 03:34 03:34 03:34 03:34 03:34 03:34 03:34 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 4070 difference to mr. marchese? not, then this does not matter. because if he did so let us talk about dr. proctor. he is an incredibly knowledgeable, well-educated man. absolutely. but he is also a very biased man. want you to think about my cross examination. would not answer a single question i asked. no matter what i asked him, he used it as springboard to get on his soapbox and, essentially, try to help mrs. marchese win her case. i he he is a very savvy, skilled, experienced and is that surprising? he is testified witness. in 80 tobacco trials. i mean, seriously, with the exception of judge murphy, my guess is he has more trial experience than everybody else in this courtroom. of course he is a good witness, he knows what he is doing. finally, at one point, i finally said, dr. what did he say? proctor, let us just be honest here, you think cigarettes should be outlawed, they should be abolished. i said, hey, dr. proctor, you do not believe that adults in this country should be permitted to decide for themselves whether to smoke? you remember he said the oddest thing, he said, well, he said yes. 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:35 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 4071 if you want to grow it in your backyard, that is fine, but you should not sell them. think about that. every state in this union has made the decision that cigarettes are a legal product and that adults in this country are free to choose whether to buy them. that is a choice that we dr. have made collectively as a free society. werner told you, i asked her -- dr. werner told you that she believes that adults have the right to make that choice for themselves. when i asked mr. marchese if she thought it was up to her husband to decide whether to smoke or not, mrs. marchese said i believe it is an individual choice. that is what most of us believe. but dr. proctor would take that choice he simply does not trust people and i was he away. careful, i said adults, i did not say kids. does not trust people to make their own decisions about how they want to live their lives. candidly, that is a dangerous thing. now, i want you to think about some of dr. proctor's other opinions. because they are cigarettes are defective, why? inhalable, they contain nicotine and nicotine is he told you that 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:36 03:37 03:37 and nicotine is nicotine occurs naturally in the addictive. cigarette a not inhalable and it does not contain nicotine, it is not a cigarette. the purpose of a cigarette is to inhale it, just like the purpose of a beer is to drink it. addictive. tobacco plant and most people smoke at least, in just like many, if not most, part, for nicotine. coffee drinkers smoke (sic), in part, for caffeine. us who like coffee, it smells great in the morning, right? and you want to sit around and, you know, talk, go have coffee with a friend. of it, that is why you have it in the morning. it is not all of it, but it is part of it. you love to have something warm it is not the only reason. for those of well, members of the jury, if a but caffeine is part basically, dr. proctor's opinion is that dr. proctor cigarettes should not be cigarettes. is not a scientist, he is not a medical doctor, he is not a social philosopher, he is not a legislator, he is a historian who has been paid $3 million testifying in tobacco cases. this year, in september when he testified, he has already been paid -- he is made between 600 and $700,000 just this year testifying in these 03:37 03:38 03:38 03:38 03:38 03:38 03:38 03:38 03:38 03:38 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:39 4073 you have heard that all the witnesses are they all have high cases. getting paid a lot of money. hourly rates, but my goodness gracious, dr. proctor takes the cake. year testifying in engle cases. bias. bias, and he does it every chance he gets. he is been paid a fortune to express that he made $700,000 last dr. proctor has a but set that all to the side and let me tell you about what i think is the most important point about dr. proctor and his testimony. i did it right from the beginning because i knew that examination going on for a while, i was not necessarily going to have a lot of clean answers, but i said first four questions, these are the first four questions i asked dr. proctor. i said, "dr. proctor, you know basically nothing about mr. marchese, right? he goes, "that is right." i said, "if the jury wants to know whether when mr. marchese started smoking or why he started smoking, you are not the person to ask?" he said, "that is right." i said, "if the jury wants to know what mr. marchese knew about the risks and whether he was addicted, you have no idea?" right" again. he said, "that is 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:39 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 4074 "and if the jury wants to know whether mr. marchese wanted to quit or ever tried to quit, you are not the guy to tell them?" right out of the box all of that is true. and he admitted dr. proctor, by his own admission, knows nothing about sal marchese and that is critically important in this case because you are being asked to award mrs. marchese for her husband's decisions to begin and continue smoking, and you cannot answer those questions unless you know why mr. marchese smoked and why he did not quit. and the simple fact is dr. proctor told you that he cannot help you answer any of those questions. case. so let us turn to the verdict form in this let just -- can we go to the elmo? so the first question is, "was salvatore marchese addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine and, if so, was his addiction a legal that is the first question, cause of his copd?" that is the class membership question. and there are really three questions you will have to decide. the first question is was sal marchese, in fact, addicted to nicotine, if so, was his addiction a legal cause of his continued smoking and did that cause him to get copd? third, did he 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:40 03:41 03:42 03:42 4075 so there are three things and it is and if actually have copd? you are being asked in that question. plaintiff's burden to prove all three. plaintiff does not meet her burden of proving any one of those three, the answer is no and the case is over. let us talk about the word "addiction." was sal marchese addicted to nicotine in cigarettes? well, judge murphy read you the jury instructions and he is going to read you at least one more after closing arguments are done, but when you look at the jury instructions, what you will find is there is nothing in the instructions that defines addiction for you. that is something you have to decide for yourselves. you have heard that the definition of dr. proctor told addiction has changed over time. you that the word "addiction" has basically lost its meaning. dr. werner said, and i wrote this down, "there is no uniform definition of addiction that is accepted by the medical community." until 1988, you heard, the surgeon general said cigarette smoking was not addictive because it is not intoxicating. in 1988, the surgeon general adopted a different definition and said it is 03:42 03:42 03:42 03:42 03:42 03:42 03:42 03:42 03:42 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 addicting. here was probably something that surprised both dr. werner and kaplan told you that you and i asked them about that because a lot you. cannot diagnose a person as addicted simply because they smoked a lot of cigarettes for a long time. of people think, i mean, if you smoked two packs a both day for 20 years, of course you are addicted. kaplan and werner told you that is not so. so they both applied the dsm-v to the information they had about mr. marchese to reach their opinions and dr. werner testified she believes under dsm-v, mr. marchese was addicted. let me digress for a second. the cage and fagerstrom surveys, dr. werner told you that those do not diagnose addiction. those are rough surveys for general practice doctors, they are an assessment of essentially the amount you smoke. she told you that psychiatrists like herself do not diagnose addiction based on cage or fagerstrom. instead, she, like dr. kaplan, uses the dsm-v, the diagnostic and statistical manual v. so what dr. werner said, she looks at all the information that was available and she said that before he tried to quit, whether it is the 90s or 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:43 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 4077 the 80s, before he tried to quit, he would have met five or six criteria and after he tried to quit, he would have met six or seven. kaplan told you that he thought he met four criteria, but he did not see any evidence of clinically significant impairment or distress, so he does not believe that mr. marchese met the requirements. but they both said, unequivocally, that like all smokers, mr. marchese had the ability to quit smoking when and if he was sufficiently motivated to quit and he made a sincere effort or efforts to quit. frankly, if you really think about kaplan and werner's testimony, look at your notes, but for their conclusion, they were not that far apart in terms of their analysis and what they said and what they relied upon. they said dsm-v is not a cookbook, they said that different positions can apply differently, depending whether you give him one or do not give him one, you can reach different conclusions. now, on cross examination, mr. oliver made a big deal about the number of cases where dr. kaplan has testified that, in his opinion, the 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:44 03:45 03:45 03:45 03:45 03:45 03:45 03:45 03:45 03:45 03:45 4078 well, is that a surprise smoker was not addicted. to anyone? so if one of the issues in the case is whether the smoker is addicted and you take a file to dr. kaplan and you say what do you think, is the person addicted? well, chances are you are not going to call him, right, because he says, well, i think he is addicted, so is that a surprise? werner said the same thing. dr. i did not go through the whole list of her questions, but i asked dr. werner, "dr. werner, you testified in 20 trials, right?" "yeah." and she said, i said, "have you ever, ever testified in and she goes, "no," and she said, trial or deposition that the smoker was not addicted?" "because when i look at a file, when a plaintiff's lawyer brings me the file, if i tell them i do not think this guy was addicted, they do not call me to testify." so i just wanted -- it was a big deal, it took a bunch of time and went through 19 or 20 cases, but dr. werner said the same thing, just on the other side of the coin. so here's the bottom line: whatever definition you choose, i'm not sure it matters 03:45 03:45 03:46 03:46 03:46 03:46 03:46 03:46 03:46 03:46 03:46 03:47 4079 much whether mr. marchese was, in fact, addicted because plaintiff has to prove more. plaintiff has to prove that addiction was a legal cause of mr. marchese's copd or he is not a class member. you will read in the instruction the definition of what legal cause is, but i want to give you an example. and we talked about this a little bit in opening, but i used a different example. the law makes the distinction between something that is a cause in fact of an injury and something that is a legal cause. about the guy that got hit by the truck and what was the cause in fact, being hit by the truck, or what was the legal cause? better example. you remember in opening i talked let me give you a so, here in florida, we all love our and we go out and we beautiful beaches, right? sunbathe and we have fun, but when we go to the doctor, what does the doctor say? doctor says wear sunscreen, wear a hat, be careful, do not get too much sun. so suppose a guy goes to the doctor and the doctor's doing a physical, hey, you got a little thing, a spot here on your arm, it is not cancer, it is no big deal, but let us take it off 03:47 03:47 03:47 03:47 03:47 03:47 03:47 03:47 03:47 03:48 03:48 03:48 03:48 03:48 4080 before it turns into anything. out, tell the receptionist that you need to make an appointment and he does not do it. so, on the way so, six months later, he comes back to the i made that you know what, now you have got skin not a big deal, has not spread, but now we doctor and the doctor says, hey, i thought we going to take this spot off your arm? in my note. cancer. have to cut the thing off, get stitches and it is going to scar, it is going to hurt. and, so, on your way out, tell my receptionist you need to make an appointment, make it quickly and let us get this thing off the arm. going. and he does not do it. so, six months later, he comes back to the doctor, you know, nothing is good and the doctor goes you have got malignant melanoma, started in your arm, but now it is spread throughout your body and, i'm sorry, but it is really serious. what was the cause in fact of his you know where this is the sun. what is the legal cause? melanoma? he ignored the warnings, ignored his doctor's advice, he did not take care of business. exactly, exactly what is happened here. and that is 1961, 1965, 1966, 1973, 1988, mrs. 03:48 03:48 03:49 03:49 03:49 03:49 03:49 03:49 03:49 03:49 03:49 4081 mr. marchese marchese's dad dies of an aneurysm. does not try to quit. single sincere, according to the surgeon general, attempt to quit. he never tried to quit. so what was the legal cause? he never makes a serious dr. werner told you that smoking is a more complex behavior than just people wanting the she said that there are behavioral nicotine. aspect to smoking. she says said some smokers smoke because it relaxes them. because it relieves anxiety and mr. marchese smoked more when he was under stress. say they like the taste of cigarettes. helps some people concentrate. the sensory aspects of smoking. smoking after a meal or with their coffee. both dr. werner and dr. kaplan told you that smoking releases dopamine, that is pleasurable. nicotine is an important reason people and some people like some people enjoy some people smoke some people smoke and nicotine smoke, but it is not the only reason. does not prevent people from quitting if they are committed to quitting. nicotine does not stop you from quitting if you are committed to quitting, but you have to try. an addiction to nicotine was not a legal cause of mr. marchese's copd. the legal 03:49 03:49 03:50 03:50 03:50 03:50 03:50 03:50 03:50 03:50 03:50 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 4082 cause was that he never tried to quit. one more important fact to consider in he was in the hospital for a couple of he was in a coma for some period of time; and both deciding this issue is the 1972 car wreck. you heard from a number of witnesses and heard since opening statement, in 1972 mr. marchese was in a car wreck. months. some of the records say a couple months. drs. werner and kaplan told you that, after a couple of days, all the nicotine was out of mr. and, of course, mr. marchese marchese's body. did not smoke while he was in the hospital. i think it is pretty well accepted that he did not smoke for a couple of months. both kaplan and werner told you that after a couple of weeks, any withdrawal symptoms he may have had had passed. both kaplan and werner told you that, after a month to six weeks, those nicotine receptors that had up regulated had down regulated and that his brain had gone back to normal. when mr. marchese left the hospital after that 2-month period, and i was very careful to be clear with dr. werner because i did not want to conflate two concepts. i got her -- and she said 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:51 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 4083 when i asked her the question, he was past any physical dependency he may have had to nicotine. sure, he still had memories, cravings can persist, particularly he smelled cigarettes, you are around somebody, you are in a bar, in places that you used to smoke, you can have cravings, but that is different. withdrawal that is driven by the presence of nicotine and brain changes. memories are different than physical so, in 1972 after two months, and i used the same phrase in opening, mr. marchese was given a mulligan, a reset, a second chance that he did not take advantage of. plaintiff's counsel suggested i was arguing that he started on day zero. been a smoker for a long time up to 1972. behaviors, he had patterns; of course, he did. had memories. symptoms. but he had no physical withdrawal he would he had he no, he did not. of course, he did not. those were gone. so, in 1972 when he made that affirmative decision to pick that cigarette up again, he was not 13-year-old boy, he was a 39-year-old husband and father of three. about the risks of smoking. about the risks of smoking. he was not confused he was not in the dark there were warnings 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:52 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:53 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 4084 he would had personal cigarette ads were no on the cigarette pack. experiences with his family where he understood the risks of smoking. longer on television or radio. every print ad. informed decision to pick up his cigarettes again, not as a 13-year-old boy. i cannot emphasize that enough. yet he made the affirmative the warning was in you have heard a lot of youth smoking, and because it is a hot because we love our kids, we are why have you heard about it? button. protective of our kids, but there was no evidence that anything the companies did caused mr. marchese to start smoking in the first instance. you heard from dr. werner that one of the most important factors in whether someone smokes is whether their family smokes. everyone in his family smoked. that in 1972 he was 39 and youth smoking had absolutely nothing to do with that decision that he made at that time. i will tell you you heard that so let us talk about copd. in order to be a member of the engle class, plaintiff has to prove that on or before november 21, 1996 mr. marchese actually had copd. so that is the 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:54 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 4085 you know what the simple did he? we do not know. question: answer is? and why do not we know? because the evidence is lacking and what evidence there is is inconsistent. now, dr. gravelyn came, he told you that his opinion mr. marchese was diagnosed with copd in 1995. gravelyn said that he would never in his practice diagnose a patient without a pft and it is undisputed there are no pfts. you know what else he said? so think about that. gravelyn is willing to diagnose mr. marchese in this courtroom using a methodology he would never, ever, ever use in his practice. that in itself is kind of remarkable, is not it? so what evidence is there? you saw the you guys actually billing record from saltzman. got to listen to his deposition and, so, you know, we had competing versions of what he said, but you and what saltzman said was he listened to it. does not know when he wrote down the word copd whether it was an actual diagnosis or a provisional diagnosis. now let me tell you something so there is no confusion. if you think somebody has symptoms 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:55 03:56 03:56 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 4086 and you want to check him out, it is not fraud to check a box and do the testing. do not you think if you go in to see your doctor, the doctor thinks you may have copd, i want to do testing and they check the box and they do it, and he goes, guess what, you do not. you are happy, you are relieved. that is not fraud, but you have to put down a provisional diagnosis for a reason to perform the test so the insurance company will pay for it. you also saw a billing receipt from dr. norensberg's office, two boxes were checked, heart disease and copd, but, again, there is no evidence of a pft or any sort of pulmonary test being and when you look at the bottom of the performed. receipt, it has a place for diagnosis of symptoms and nothing is written down. filling that out while he was seeing the patient, why would not he write down the symptoms and the diagnosis as opposed to checking boxes for tests? if norensberg was you know, mrs. marchese's testimony was confusing and that is not surprising, it was not intentional; we are talking about things that happened a long time ago. but mrs. marchese testified initially that it was dr. patel in new york and then she remembered, when she testified 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:57 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 4087 on the stand, it was saltzman in 1995 here in florida. terry irwin, her daughter, says, hey, i remember my mom telling me when they were living in florida in 1995 norensberg and saltzman, so that is what i remember now. but, interestingly, dr. werner, plaintiff's own expert, when she reviewed all of the information, the medical records and the depositions, remember, she wrote down 1993. own expert does not agree, based on all the depositions that she reviewed and all the evidence, that it is clear that saltzman diagnosed him in '95. reviewing all of the evidence. werner thought it was '93 based on their you know, there are medical records from the 2000s which say mr. marchese had copd, particularly the ones from the 2000 -- may 2004 hospitalization that polsky wrote, and there are others, including handwritten patient questionnaires, that say -- do not list a history of copd or shortness of breath. in the 2000s where mr. marchese denies a history of copd or shortness of breath. when you look at the prescription medical records, there is no records that he received any breathing treatments there are records 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:58 03:59 03:59 03:59 4088 whatsoever before 2003. so, did he have copd and did it manifest it is unclear. and/or before november 21, 1996? and it is plaintiff's burden to prove that he did. and if plaintiff does not meet the burden, then he is not a class member. but here's really the interesting what if he did? what if dr. gravelyn question: is right and in 1995 dr. saltzman, in fact, diagnosed him with copd? well, if he was, gravelyn told you that no doubt -- can you switch, michael -- he said no doubt that mr. marchese and dr. saltzman would have had this conversation. dr. saltzman would have said, hey, sal, it is not a let me tell you, you have mild copd. big deal, you know. right now, you will be okay, but it is progressive, and if you keep on smoking, sal, you are in for serious problems. what if you quit smoking and dr. gravelyn said that no doubt saltzman would have said, hey, listen, if you need help in quitting, i'll help you. and you remember polsky said it was both polsky and norensberg's practice to help their patients quit smoking if they wanted assistance. 03:59 03:59 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:00 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 4089 dr. gravelyn told you by 1995 nicotine gum was on the market, patch was on the market, people are quitting with hypnosis and acupuncture and counseling, and dr. gravelyn told you that any doctor worth his or her salt would have said, hey, mr. marchese, you have to stop, you have to stop now and i will help you. so think about that. if dr. gravelyn is right, then in 1995, dr. saltzman told mr. marchese your smoking has caught up with you, you it is mild, but if you keep smoking, have copd. and you can literally smoke yourself to death. mrs. marchese told you that when he was told to stop smoking after he was diagnosed with copd, he did not try. members of the jury, an addiction to instead, it was his nicotine was not a legal cause of mr. marchese's smoking-related diseases. decision to keep smoking and to ignore all of the warning signs, to ignore all the information and to make no effort to quit for 30 years after he understood that smoking was dangerous and caused disease and death. can we switch back over? and i respectfully suggest, members of the 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:01 04:02 04:02 04:02 04:02 04:02 04:02 04:02 04:02 04:02 04:02 04:02 04:02 04:03 04:03 04:03 04:03 4090 jury, that the evidence is overwhelming that plaintiff has not met her burden of proving that mr. marchese is a member of the engle class. if you agree, you should check no, you should ring the buzzer and just tell the court that you have reached your verdict. okay. a second question is did mr. i already talked about that. marchese's copd manifest on or before november 21, 1996. the evidence plaintiff has is inconsistent and inconclusive. the burden, and based on the inconsistent evidence, i do not believe plaintiff has met her burden. to that as well. i would respectfully suggest you check no for all the reasons i've already discussed, you should check no to question 3. and then that gets us to comparative okay. so question 4 says please state the fault. percentage of any responsibility for sal marchese's death that you charge to mr. marchese, philip morris, r.j. reynolds. and mr. oliver mentioned this, too, but let me be very clear about this and it is in the jury instructions. you never get well, first let me tell you this: to comparative fault unless you decide that mr. 04:03 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:04 4091 these you never get this far on marchese was a member of the engle class. are separate questions. the verdict form, you do not consider this unless plaintiff has met her burden of question 1, question 2, and question 3. this far, this is where you assign responsibility among three parties. but if you do get now, and mr. oliver told you this, the and if you answered yes to next two questions are their intentional torts, conspiracy and fraud. either of the next two questions, comparative if you decide fault does not apply in this case. based on the facts that mr. marchese is 95 percent responsible, if you answer yes to question 5 or question 6, comparative fault is out the window and mrs. marchese gets a hundred percent of the damages. understands that. all right. i want to make sure that everyone so let us talk about this case. how do you answer this question? evidence is clear since the 1960s mr. marchese understood smoking was dangerous and caused disease and death and he did not try to quit. well, the the evidence is clear since the 1970s when mrs. marchese quit smoking that mr. marchese 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:04 04:05 04:05 04:05 4092 understood smoking was hard to quit yet, for decades, he made no effort whatsoever. i already talked about that; frankly, there is not much more to say. but let me say one thing that is important: i want you to think back to opening statement. mr. oliver said in opening statement that while mrs. marchese may not think that sal is to blame, that on her behalf, they have taken the position and they admit that mr. marchese bears some responsibility for his decision to smoke and the plaintiff accepts some fault in this case. in they did not say that in closing. closing, he said defendants deserve the lion's share, so that suggests they are suggesting that plaintiff gets some responsibility, but mr. oliver told you in opening statement that the plaintiff accepts some fault. so i want you to think about what that it could only mean, it could only mean means. that plaintiff admits that mr. marchese understood the risks of smoking and had the ability to quit and had the ability to quit in time to avoid his risk or how could he have any fault? i want you to think about that. 04:05 04:05 04:06 04:06 04:06 04:06 04:06 04:06 04:06 04:06 04:06 04:07 04:07 04:07 04:07 04:07 4093 if plaintiff admits, as mr. oliver said in opening statement, that mr. marchese has some responsibility, he can only have responsibility if he understood the risks and he had the ability to quit in time to avoid getting sick. and if you believe that is true, then you should write down one hundred percent for sal marchese because they admitted he could have avoided his injuries and only mr. marchese was in a position to do that. let us go to the fraud questions. again, if you answer yes to either 5 or 6, comparative fault is out the window no matter what you decide in terms of how responsibilities should be allocated. so this question, did salvatore marchese reasonably rely to his detriment on any statement of material fact made by each defendant that concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available to him concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes and, if so, was the concealment a legal cause of sal marchese's death. that is a mouthful. that is a long question; that is a mouthful, so let us kind of break it down. so what does plaintiff have to prove? mr. oliver said it very succinctly, did mr. and 04:07 04:07 04:07 04:07 04:07 04:07 04:07 04:07 04:07 04:07 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:08 4094 marchese rely, but on what? plaintiff has to prove that her husband reasonably relied on a statement, on a statement, that concealed or otherwise omitted material information not otherwise known to him concerning the health effects or addictive nature. so here's the question: what was the what do they claim was the statement? statement? plaintiff did not point to a single statement that her husband ever heard about smoking and health. i asked her, i said, mrs. marchese, have you ever heard the of the council for tobacco research. she said nope. did you ever discuss that with your husband? no. did you ever hear of the tobacco institute? no. tobacco industry research council? no -- or committee. no. did you discuss any of those organizations with your husband? no. mrs. marchese, can you think of any statement you ever heard from philip morris or r.j. reynolds about the risks of smoking? no. do you recall hearing any statement from a 04:08 04:08 04:08 04:09 04:09 04:09 04:09 04:09 04:09 04:09 04:09 04:09 4095 tobacco company about the risks of smoking? so what mr. oliver said, well, it was no. let us talk about causes of causes, well, how about all the people would not -- if advertising. it is advertising. who saw the ads that did not smoke? that is the cause of causes, would not that cause those people to smoke, too? with respect to cigarettes, mrs. marchese said she never discussed cigarettes with mr. marchese and she does not know why he smoked the brands he smoked or why he smoked filters, but mr. oliver said, well, he smoked marlboro because of the ads. marlboro ads. right, it was the marlboro man, the mrs. marchese did not say that. well, let me tell you another possible he switched from is not that an explanation for why he smoked marlboro; that was the brand his wife smoked. unfiltered lucky's to filtered marlboros and that was the brand his wife smoked. equally likely explanation as to why he chose that brand? because he thought they were safer because their position is that he does not know smoking was dangerous, so if he does not know smoking was dangerous, why would you switch to a safer he said, well, he switched to filters 04:09 04:10 04:10 04:11 4096 cigarette? was unsafe. he did not think the other cigarette and mrs. marchese, i specifically asked her, did he ever tell you why he smoked filters? no. did he ever tell you why he smoked marlboro? no. did you ever have a conversation about why he smoked marlboro? no. but here's the other thing: how could he possibly believe that marlboro was safe when that was the brand his wife was smoking that she believed contributed to her breast cancer? sense, common experience. his wife smoked that she believed caused her breast cancer. believe that marlboro was safe? common marlboro was the brand so how could he possibly, possibly he never smoked light cigarettes. mrs. marchese said he never said he was angry at the tobacco companies or blamed them in any way for his smoking decisions. statement. heard of the frank statement? i asked mrs. marchese, have you ever heard about the frank she said no. ever discussed it with your husband? the simple fact is plaintiff did not no. 04:11 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:12 4097 testify about anything that mr. marchese ever heard or read from a cigarette company. and if he did not hear it, or he did not read it, he could not have relied on it reasonably or otherwise. but the fact is, members of the jury, there is no evidence whatsoever that mr. marchese was ever confused about the risks of smoking or that he was waiting for the tobacco companies to tell him something. he personally understood smoking caused disease; it was hard to quit. and, finally, in order to recover under this, even if you get past all that, plaintiff has to prove that her husband had not heard the statement, whatever it was, he would have quit smoking and would not have gotten sick. pendell told you he could not quit. it. he could not do but mr. so think about that. they are saying, well, if there was something that he said, we do not know what it was, but if there was, then that made a difference, and if you would not have said it, he would not have gotten sick because he would have quit even though we are telling the jury he could not quit. so i'm telling you, the evidence is 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:12 04:13 04:13 04:13 04:13 04:13 04:13 04:13 04:13 04:13 04:13 4098 and just like mr. oliver said, as it goes overwhelming that the answer to question 5 is no and no. to question 5, goes question 6. so now we are at damages. how much time do i have, your honor, do you know? the court: you have 7 minutes, counsel -- excuse me, i apologize. warning comes in 7 minutes. that is the 5-minute you have 12 minutes. mr. cofer: okay, damages. i'll be done by then. so, if you get this far, i cannot. you met mrs. marchese, and let me just tell you, i cannot help you you are asked what is the total amount of damages, if any, sustained by mrs. marchese for the loss of her husband's companionship and protection and her pain and suffering as a result of her husband's death. with this. you have heard about the relationship that she had with her husband. you have heard that they had a mr. oliver said wonderful marriage for 46 years. it better than anyone could, she lost her lover, she lost her husband, she lost her best friend. and if you decide that she is entitled to recover, you are going to have to rely on your own judgment to decide what is a fair and appropriate amount. 04:13 04:13 04:14 04:14 04:14 04:14 04:14 04:14 04:14 04:14 04:14 04:15 4099 that is what he said, a million but i do want to say one thing, i have to because mr. oliver suggested that you award her $11 million. dollars a year. for most of us, when you hear that sum of money, it is hard to even put it in context, but you remember, i asked dr. proctor, i said what is the average household income in state do you of florida. know how many years it would take to earn $11 million? he said it is $50,000 a year. mr. oliver: objection, your honor, inappropriate argument. the court: mr. cofer: overruled. it would take 220 years. it would take the average family 220 years to earn the amount of money that mr. oliver is asking you to award his client. but you know what, you decide, if you get this far, you decide what you think is fair and you decide what you think is appropriate. so let me get to the last topic and that is punitive damages, so this is -- that is just up to you. i'm just taking a pass. all right. so punitive damages, please state whether you find by clear and convincing 04:15 04:15 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 4100 okay. evidence that punitive damages are warranted against any of the defendants listed below. so, again, you only get to this question if you answered yes to 5 or 6. if you answer no to the conspiracy and no to concealment, then you never get the punitive damages. have proven their case on conspiracy that it harmed mr. marchese and on concealment, then you get there. but if you believe they if you decide there but i want you to think about what it is that you are asked to decide. you are not being asked to decide an amount of punitive damages. you are being asked to decide whether punitive damages may be appropriate. are, there will be another phase to the trial. they will put on evidence, we will put on evidence, we will have closing arguments, and that is so, in when you would get to the amount stage. thinking about this question, do not even think about amount. the issue is whether they have shown they may be entitled. when you look at the instructions, you will see that the term "clear and convincing" is defined. they talked about the greater weight of the evidence, the one grain of sand or the one 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:16 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 4101 that is not the mill of wheat or whatever it is. case for punitive damages. convincing. it is clear and it is a much higher standard. you have the jury instructions and it says the evidence must be precise, explicit, lacking in confusion and in such weight that produces a firm belief or conviction without hesitation about the it is a much higher standard. matter at issue. you have to be really, really, really convinced that punitive damages are appropriate in this case. and like mr. oliver told you, you can only okay. other people can if someone believes decide that they can only be warranted based on conduct that actually harmed sal marchese. it is not about other people. bring their own lawsuits. that they have been harmed by the actions of philip morris or reynolds, they can bring their own lawsuits and have their own jury decide. so this is a case about sal marchese, and under the law, you can only punish the conduct that harmed sal marchese. i respectfully suggest to you, members of the jury, that nothing philip morris or r.j. reynolds did harmed sal marchese. we sold 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:17 04:18 04:18 04:18 04:18 04:18 04:18 04:18 04:18 04:18 4102 cigarettes are a legal product. cigarettes. you are instructed in the jury verdict instructions that you cannot base liability on that. that he smoked, the fact that he got a smoking-related disease in and of itself does not entitle him to recover any damages, much less punitive damages. the fact you have heard about the engle findings. the engle findings alone cannot be a basis for liability. again, that is in the verdict form. the engle jury heard nothing about sal marchese. they know absolutely nothing about him at all. the evidence was and is that mr. marchese always had the information he needed to make an informed decision to quit, that just like the 60 million people that have quit, he had the ability to quit if and when he decided he was willing to make an effort to quit. dr. proctor spent two days talking about the culture of cigarette smoking but admitted he does not know anything about sal marchese, and he never showed you one document, he never showed you one snippet that he tied to mr. marchese or any of his decisions. the court: five minutes, counsel. 04:19 04:19 04:19 04:19 04:19 04:19 04:19 04:19 04:19 04:20 04:20 04:20 04:20 04:20 4103 in terms you have thank you. mr. cofer: in terms of deterrence, the purpose of punitive damages is to punish and to deter, to punish conduct that harmed mr. marchese. of deterrence, what have we learned? learned that the companies no longer advertise on billboards or public transit or stadiums, and they you learned that the philip have not for 17 years. morris voluntarily stopped advertising in magazines a decade ago. philip morris and reynolds have both had websites that specifically say smoking causes cancer, smoking is addictive, there is no such thing as a safe cigarette, and they have links that say if you want information about smoking, you can click on our link, it will take you to the surgeon general's, it will take you to the national cancer institute, take you to nida. for the last 15 years, since 2009, companies have been subject to extensive fda regulation, and proctor told you that smoking rates, and specifically youth smoking rates, are lower than they have ever been in our nation's history. the fact is that philip morris is a much different company now than it was and i 04:20 04:20 04:20 04:20 04:20 04:20 04:20 04:20 04:20 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 4104 respectfully suggest to you that philip morris -- i'm sorry, that the plaintiff has not met her burden of proving that punitive damages are appropriate in this case and that you should, if you get this far, you should say no. okay. so what is this case about? you know i told you in opening statement that this case is about one smoker, whether he was a member of the engle class and whether mrs. marchese is entitled to recover money for his decisions to begin and continue smoking. i told you it is a case about sal marchese and what he knew about the risks of smoking and what he did with that information and why he chose to continue to smoke. i told you the evidence would be that mr. marchese knew for decades smoking was dangerous and that mr. marchese always had the ability to quit whenever he made an effort to quit, and that nothing the companies did or did not do, say or did not say, caused him to begin or continue smoking, and i believe we have delivered on that. you know, i want to say one thing. you have seen mrs. marchese, you met her family and you know that she lost her husband and her best friend and it is natural to feel sympathy in that 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:21 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 4105 i mean, we would not situation. of course, it is. be human if we did not, right? but the law and you are instructed that your decision cannot be based on sympathy. you took an oath that your verdict must be based on the law and the evidence that you have heard in this courtroom for the last couple weeks. your verdict -- and it cannot. now, back in jury selection, i told you that all we really wanted, i told you there are two sides to every story and all we wanted was a fair shot to tell our side of the story. i know you have given that to us and i want to tell you how much we appreciate it. and i also told you in jury selection, and this is true no matter what you decide, we have the greatest system civil justice the world has ever known. it is the envy of the world and it has been for hundreds of years. and the reason why we have such a great system of justice is because men and women like you who are willing to take time out of your lives and to sit here in court and put up with all the lawyers and all of our nonsense, all the delays and all that stuff, to help parties resolve disputes that they could not resolve on their own. 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:22 04:23 04:23 04:23 04:23 04:23 04:23 04:23 04:23 04:23 4106 on behalf of my client, i think on behalf of everyone who has been in front of you for the last two weeks, thank you very, very much for your service and thank you for your attention; we appreciate it very much. mr. isasi: thank you. may it please the court, mrs. marchese and counsel, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. we are going to move quickly here, i promise you; i know i'm standing between you and the door. but after everything that is been said, there are three undisputed facts, three, that really give you all the information you need to answer the questions in this case. the first, the first fact is that in the 1960s, due to smoking-related illnesses that were 04:29 04:29 04:29 04:29 04:29 04:29 04:30 04:30 04:30 4108 occurring in the marchese family, the marchese household, mr. and mrs. marchese, they were fully aware that there were health risks associated with smoking. fact number two, in 1972 marchese stopped smoking for two months, at least two months, and then he made a decision to resume smoking when nicotine was no longer affecting his body in any way. and in 1973, the third fact, mrs. marchese was told by her doctors that her cancer was caused by smoking and that quitting smoking would prevent a reoccurrence of cancer, she shared that information with her husband and she began the process of quitting. so that, by 1974, she had stopped smoking; she never smoked another cigarette again. so, even if you were to conclude that mr. marchese did have copd, if he had stayed a nonsmoker in 1972 when he stopped smoking for at least two months, or if he had joined his wife in the quit attempt and stopped smoking in 1973, the evidence is more likely than not he would have prevented his own illness. you everything you need to know to answer the those three facts give 04:30 04:30 04:30 04:31 04:31 04:31 04:31 04:31 04:31 04:31 04:31 04:31 04:32 04:32 04:32 questions in this case. we plucked you out of your lives. before i discuss the rest of the evidence, i want to join everyone else here who has thanked you. we know, we have heard you guys in the jury room on breaks, sounds like you have been getting along, having good time, maybe even made some friends. but all that being said, it cannot have been easy to serve on we recognize the personal sacrifice this jury. that that is. everyone in this courtroom, the judge, the lawyers, the parties, we all volunteered. this courtroom. of all of us, we thank you for the personal sacrifice that you have made. we made a decision that put us in you were drafted. so, on behalf and in recognition of that, i'm going to try to be as respectful of your time now as i was throughout the trial and not take up a lot of time with a lot of questions. now, one of the areas i'd like to walk around is this is huizenga park. it is at the end of andrews right across the bridge, right on las olas, and they have this great fountain there, the i do not know if you have ever musical fountain. been there, but it plays music and the fountain 04:32 04:32 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 4110 stream kind of bounces up and down with the beat, things like that. it is a really nice place to go and just kind of clear your mind. i was walking to that park just a couple days ago, approaching the fountain, and it occurred to me that when you get there, you have to make a decision. you are on a path and you have to make a decision; you have to go one way around the fountain or the other, right or left. choose to walk on one side or the other. and it struck me that in a very real he would had that serious car accident, he sense, this is what is mr. marchese faced in 1972 when he returned home from the hospital. he had a you know the story choice, he had a path to walk. by now. was in a coma for two months, and during that time he went through a process. his system after one or two days, the peak of withdrawal would have been within the first week. that can be very difficult for some people, but not for mr. marchese because he was unconscious during that. nicotine was out of and as you see, by the time he left the hospital, withdrawal symptoms had all passed and those brain changes you have been hearing about, the 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:33 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 4111 receptors, all that, all returned to normal. his brain would have looked exactly like someone who had never smoked. and there is other stuff going on. right in his family, he is had family members who got seriously ill, and in some cases, passed during the 1960s because of smoking-related illnesses. and warning labels, this is the warning label that was on cigarettes back in 1972. warning: cigarette smoking is hazardous to your health. the surgeon general has determined that now, i heard some discussion from plaintiff's counsel about mr. marchese being a high school dropout and a bricklayer, and i'm not sure what that was supposed to mean, but i'll tell you this: not a doctor. language of science. benzo(a)pyrene is a carcinogen that has been shown to cause x percent or anything like that. this is written in the language of people, people can plainly understand that. they said he is not a scientist, he is this label is not written in the this is not, you know, a now you heard allegations about teenage brains and marketing of teenagers, but at this he is a 39-year-old point, he is not a teenager. 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:34 04:35 04:35 04:35 04:35 04:35 04:35 04:35 04:35 04:35 04:35 4112 he decides to go back to smoking. adult, and when he leaves the hospital after two and a half months of not smoking, what does he choose to do? we do not have to guess what mr. marchese would have done if he had known about the risks of smoking, like they say that he did not, and what he would have done if he was not under the influence of nicotine. moment. we know, we know because that is this the path, the choice that he made. no nicotine in his system, his family members are getting smoking-related illnesses and every pack of cigarettes that he smoked the year before the accident, the year of the accident, the year after the accident, all had this warning on them in plain english. so what he did was he made the same informed choice that millions of smokers, both then and now today, make. aware of the risks, comfortable with those risks, and he chose to continue to smoke. and there is no evidence, none, plaintiffs did not even argue it to you today, that the reason he chose to start smoking again in 1972 was because of something that r.j. reynolds or philip morris said or did not say. 04:35 04:35 04:36 04:36 04:36 04:36 04:36 04:36 04:36 04:36 04:36 04:37 04:37 04:37 mr. pendell tried to explain to you that this was the silver lining in this mr. marchese could not stop smoking, he just could not, but in 1972, he already had for more -- at least two months and maybe more, he had not smoked. accident. and all those physiological changes in smoking, even dr. werner said they were gone when he left the hospital. he got a chance to reboot, to restart. they want you to speculate about memory tracks and cues, but here's the most important part: no one testified that, at this moment in 1972 when mr. marchese left the hospital, no one told you that he tried to quit and that he could not because of cues or memory tracks or anything like that. to resume smoking. he simply made the decision every time mr. marchese picked up a pack and not one of the plaintiff's experts or of cigarettes, he had a choice, and he made a choice. any of the plaintiff's witnesses contradicted that. he made one choice, and a year later in 1973, his wife made a different choice. after all the is the interesting thing. and this 04:37 04:37 04:37 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 4114 documents, all the testimony you heard, the plaintiffs never answered the riddle that i posed to you in my opening statement. i asked how is it that in 1973 gertrude marchese had enough information to make the choice to quit smoking the exact same cigarettes that her husband was smoking and salvatore marchese did not. difference between the two of them? knowledge. the same warnings on the packs at this point. they all had the same information about the family illnesses. they were in the same house, they were hearing the same things. them were smoking cigarettes with nicotine. was choice. not nicotine, both of it they were smoking the same cigarettes, what was the not lack of mrs. marchese this is what she told you from the of course, he could quit; he chose not to. and you know who agrees with me that mr. marchese and only mr. marchese could have made the choice to commit to quitting smoking? herself. stand. to your husband to decide whether he wanted to quit smoking or not, right?" mrs. marchese, and her answer was, "oh, i think it is an individual choice, yeah." she was asked, "and you believe it was up 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:38 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 04:39 now, we know why mr. marchese started smoking again. he enjoyed smoking and he wanted to smoke. you have heard the testimony from his friend john giglio who had known mr. marchese for a long time, since his teenage years, and this is what mr. giglio told you. enjoyed smoking? he sat and watched him smoke for years. opportunity to assess this. yeah, i think he enjoyed it." "do you think he he had an mr. marchese was simply the type of person dr. werner agreed who understood the risks of smoking and was comfortable taking those risks. with me that there are people like that. are people who have no desire to quit smoking even though they know smoking is dangerous, said i'm sure there are individuals out there that fit that description. there now, mr. pendell said in his closing that is not what the evidence showed. mr. argument to you that mr. marchese was not a risk taker. do not have to take my word for it, okay? marchese was the type of person who is comfortable taking risks with his health. dr. polsky. was his treating physician. he sat in that stand right there. he had no stake in we know that from you he 04:40 04:40 04:40 04:40 04:40 04:40 04:40 04:40 04:40 04:41 04:41 04:41 04:41 04:41 4116 he is not asking what the outcome of this litigation. you for millions and millions of dollars. did he tell you about mr. marchese? through his medical record and i asked him, "so what you are reporting here is not just that physicians had thought it was in mr. marchese's best interest to have these additional tests done, but he refused those tests, right? we went right. now mr. marchese was an adult, right? yes. right, and he was entitled to make that decision, right, that decision? correct. not to have the additional testing done? correct. he could make that decision even if it was not in the best interest of his own health to those tests, right?" the answer was, "of course." mr. marchese made decisions that sometimes are not in his own -- the best interests of his own health. now i want to be clear about one thing: i'm not criticizing mr. marchese for any of this. 04:41 04:41 04:41 04:41 04:41 04:41 04:41 04:41 04:41 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 4117 neither i or mr. cofer, nothing we say should be interpreted as a criticism of him. he made the decision that it was an absolute right as an adult in this country to do. smoke. and in this society, cigarettes are legal and they are legal not because they are safe but because we understand that people have a right to make choices like that for themselves. he made the decision to mrs. marchese wants you to award millions you heard the fact that she disagree they they were two independent people, of dollars because mr. marchese made a choice, which she respected at the time he made it, but with hindsight, now she disagrees with. no testimony from anyone, from all the family members who are here, that she hounded mr. marchese, tried to get him to stop quitting. made decisions. she respected that. with it now that the consequences of those choices have become apparent does not change the fact that he was an independent they were his choices. person. the family let him make those choices and, frankly, he is entitled to have us respect those decisions now. you heard from his daughter theresa irwin. she took the stand. we asked her and she said 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:42 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 4118 that mr. marchese never talked about suing a tobacco company. plaintiffs, he had been suffering from copd since mid 90s. even though, according to the i'm going to skip through a couple things. here's the slide i was looking for before from mrs. marchese, said that the decision to quit smoking is an individual choice. let me just briefly discuss mr. marchese's i told you at the beginning that smoking history. the evidence would show that mr. marchese in his life and his smoking history, the cigarettes made by reynolds were just not a significant factor and now here, at the end, there is really no dispute about that. the evidence is clear mr. marchese did not so they were just a small smoking lucky none, including during this second chance smoke reynolds cigarettes at all for a 40-year period. he got in 1972. percentage of his smoking history. strikes until 1962, smoked doral beginning in about 2002, although he smoked other cigarettes as well. what you have to consider with respect to that question. that is the evidence before you and that is 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:43 04:44 04:44 04:44 4119 now, i'm just going to add one thing about dr. proctor because i think mr. cofer has covered him very well. dr. proctor made it clear that he did not know anything about mr. marchese or any statements, anything, about that he might have, as you can see here, heard, saw or relied upon. that is for reynolds, brown & williamson, american tobacco. marchese ever heard, saw or relied on any specific statements by a tobacco company." "you are not here to testify that mr. we do not have to guess or speculate about what mr. marchese would have done if someone had told him smoking was dangerous earlier in his life because he was getting that message for decades. and this is just we put together a couple slides that show all the different instances going back to 1961. members that were going on. things like the surgeon general's report or the articles that were appearing in life or reader's digest just in his household. instances where the risks of smoking were being made known to him. this is just the personal household this does not include all of these you heard plaintiff's counsel say that, in 1973 when mrs. marchese was warned about smoking, 04:44 04:45 04:46 04:46 04:46 04:46 04:46 04:46 04:46 4120 she quit that mr. pendell said they did not talk about that. i'm not sure how that struck you. smoking, she had breast cancer and she was told not to smoke because it would -- it could cause a reoccurrence, but you can just take mrs. marchese's word for it, she said this is -- remember, what the lawyers say what the evidence here's what mrs. is, this is a perfect example. marchese actually said. "you told mr. marchese when you were diagnosed with breast cancer, you came home and you told mr. marchese that your doctors told you your cancer could be related to your smoking, right? yes, i'm sure i mentioned it." so there is no question, there is no debate about whether or not this was known to mr. marchese. marchese household about the risks of smoking. there is no doubt or controversy in the now, mr. oliver said something very interesting and i wrote it down. source of information matters. information matters, and we agree. to questions about what people believe, what messages people believe. we have some when it comes he said that the source of 04:46 04:46 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 4121 information, i asked dr. proctor about this, the roper surveys. these were done in 1959 and there was another one in 1970 and they asked people, on questions of smoking and health, who would you believe. something from american cancer society. people like dr. hammond and dr. graham, the mouse painting studies. 3 percent would believe a tobacco industry research council. 1959, 39 percent would say they believe down here, 3 percent. that is that is it. 1970. so now we are just a couple years before mr. marchese has his automobile accident. here's a list of different organizations who are the most reliable sources of information on smoking and health. again, american cancer society way up there, ama, medical schools. here at the bottom, the tobacco companies. down and this is what is important. because under the law that you have been given by the judge, even if they had presented proof to you that mr. marchese saw any of these statements that they have been talking about, where is the proof he relied on them? requires. because that is what the law and here is further proof, there is no 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:47 04:48 04:48 04:48 4122 evidence of reliance on the question of smoking and health and that is what is important? whether or not a cigarette one cigarette tastes better or looks more masculine or something like that; the issue here is smoking and health and we know what people were thinking. not you know -- and what is not listed on here that is the is information from his own family. most credible source, when he talks to his wife and she says the doctor warned me about the risks of smoking and cancer. who there is now, maybe, maybe there is a smoker out there who falls in this 3 percent, someone who did not have family in the 60s and the 70s warning them about the risks of smoking. actual evidence heard statements from some tobacco spokesperson or something like that and believed them or went to their family and said, you know, i mean, i've heard the surgeon general's report but i'm just not sure. there is a connection. like that who falls in that, but that is not salvatore marchese. showed. throughout his life. it is not clear to me that maybe there is a smoker that is not what the evidence he had the information, the warnings, 04:48 04:48 04:48 04:48 04:49 04:49 04:49 04:49 04:49 04:49 04:49 04:49 04:49 4123 now, the last topic i'm going to cover is this question of punitive damages. respectfully, as you work your way through the verdict form, and i will not do that because i thought mr. cofer did that for you, this is not a question that we believe you should get to, but you are the final deciders on that, so i need to talk about it for a moment. what you are being asked to do is after -- and then punitive to get there, you have to decide that there is liability, you have to award damages which fully compensate mrs. marchese. damages, they are saying -- they are asking you to check a box that says, in addition, we may award damages beyond what is necessary to fully and fairly compensate mrs. marchese, additional money, bonus money. judge, that only happens if the plaintiffs provided compelling evidence of the need to punish and deter. and that is only -- you heard the you saw evidence of the efforts of reynolds to address the health risks of smoking. and i want to just remind you of that when you consider this question. this is the president of r.j. reynolds telling the this goes back to 1968. 04:50 04:50 04:50 04:50 04:50 04:50 04:50 04:50 04:50 04:51 4124 head of research to, "push forward concerning tobacco and health, and if there is a safer cigarette, let us continue and increase our efforts." and that led to reynolds participating in the national cancer institute, tobacco working group. the other things that you heard the testimony about, empirical literature to the surgeon general. dr. proctor even was forced to admit that industry has funded more of the work that is gone in the surgeon general's report than the tobacco industry, and that reynolds as well as philip morris has made substantial payments under the master settlement agreement and the florida settlement agreement. question of punishment, you have to ask yourself what punishment is needed. when it gets to the the reynolds website, you heard mr. cofer and reynolds has expended talk about that. significant efforts to try to make safer cigarettes. about that. that was premier. dollars trying to develop a cigarette that you did not burn because it is the combustion of tobacco significant efforts, you have heard i'll just to remind you about one and reynolds spent a billion 04:51 04:51 04:51 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 that leads to the carcinogens being released. was tobacco got heated but not burned. it they published that big publication that i held up, waved around during dr. proctor's examination, that detailed all of the research and showed the reduction in carcinogens. now, it was not commercially successful, but reynolds did not give up and they used that same technology that they put into premier to develop another cigarette eclipse, which dr. proctor also told you again reduced the level of carcinogens. they want you to punish the tobacco so the people you have been hearing about, claude teague, robert heimann, alan rodgman, you heard the evidence, they have long since left the company. companies today for conduct going back, in some instances, 50 years. respectfully, we suggest that punitive damages should not be awarded against the tobacco companies that expended that kind of energy, that kind of money trying to develop safer cigarettes and who publicly admitted the risks associated with smoking. now, this is it. i'm going to sit down. mr. oliver and mr. pendell will have their last chance to talk to you. i expect they may say, you 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:52 04:53 04:53 04:54 04:54 4126 know, i could respond to all of this if i had the time to do it, but i do not, and the question i have for you all is i did not raise anything new. if they have not responded, if you are not convinced of something, then that means they failed to meet their burden of proof. their burden of proof, you are empowered. you have been empowered to set aside sympathy and prejudice and compassion and make the decision just based on the evidence that is been presented to you. and we respectfully suggest that, based on that, you should return a verdict in favor of r.j. reynolds and philip morris. if they failed to meet so thank you for your attention and your time today. deliberations. i wish you the best in your
