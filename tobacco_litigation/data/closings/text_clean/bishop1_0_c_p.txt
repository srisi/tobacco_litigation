12 closing argument 10:54 mr. clark: good morning. i came down with a 10:54 little bit of a stuffy nose this morning, so i 10:54 apologize for my coughing and my voice this 10:54 morning. 10:54 what i want to do -- you have been given a lot 10:54 of evidence in this case, a lot of evidence. in 10:54 fact, the cart's full of it. 10:54 but those documents all have different 10:54 relevance to different issues that you are going to 10:54 have to decide. 10:54 and i know we went through it pretty quickly 10:54 during the testimony with the witnesses, but what i 10:55 want to do is give you an opportunity to write down 10:55 some of those numbers and what we believe the 10:55 evidence -- what claims the evidence go to, because 10:55 there is going to be a lot of documents. i think 10:55 there is about 160 different pieces of evidence that 10:55 you will get. and if you are looking for something, 10:55 this will give you an idea of where to start. 10:55 you have been with us now for almost two and a 10:55 half weeks. and you have heard this before. you will 10:55 hear it again. i do not believe i'll be the last 10:55 one to say it, but we do thank you for your time. 10:55 we have tried to go through this case as quickly 10:55 as possible. we try to give you the evidence as 10:55 concise and quickly as possible. we want to 10:55 respect your time. we know your time is valuable. 10:55 and i think everybody here, including the court and 10:55 the defendants, appreciate the sacrifices you have 10:55 made to be here. 10:55 but nonetheless, we are here. and we have got 10:55 some questions that we need you to answer. so i'm 10:56 only going to spend a little bit of time with you 10:56 this morning; and then i'm going to defer some time 10:56 to mr. berg, who is going to talk to you about some 10:56 other issues. 10:56 the questions that you will have to answer on 10:56 the verdict form we will talk about in my portion 10:56 here or at least a bulk of them we will talk about in 10:56 my portion. what i plan to do is i plan to give 10:56 you some reminders of what you heard and what you 10:56 saw during the last two weeks from the witnesses on 10:56 the stand and from the documents and the slides 10:56 that we showed you. 10:56 what i want to talk just briefly about is 10:56 robert ramsay. family and his friends called him 10:56 bert. we know a little bit about mr. ramsay. we 10:56 do not know everything. 10:56 we know that he began smoking when he was in 10:56 his teens. we know that mrs. ramsay [sic] met him 10:56 when he was 17 years old, just a few weeks after 10:56 turning 17. 10:57 we know that he was smoking camel unfiltered 10:57 cigarettes at that time. the medical records tell 10:57 us that he was smoking enough to put his smoking -- 10:57 that he began smoking back during his teenage 10:57 years. 10:57 what we showed you was documents from 10:57 r.j. reynolds reflecting that smokers begin smoking 10:57 approximately when they are 16.7, i believe, was 10:57 the actual amount. so roughly 16 years of age is a 10:57 good -- a good starting point for when people start 10:57 smoking. 10:57 and we know from the evidence that mr. ramsay 10:57 fit right square in the middle of that time period. 10:57 we know that in 1958, when mr. ramsay was 17 10:57 years old and he was smoking camel unfiltered, we 10:57 know that there were no warnings on cigarette 10:57 packs. we know there was no surgeon general's 10:57 report. 10:58 the warnings that were read to you in your 10:58 instructions that you will see, those warnings did not 10:58 go on until 1966, two years after the release of 10:58 the first original surgeon general's report. 10:58 the documents that we submitted to you that 10:58 were written by the scientists, the executives, the 10:58 directors, the chairman of the board, whoever it 10:58 might be from these two defendants, those secret 10:58 documents, they were never meant to see the light 10:58 of day. but they did. and we brought them to you. 10:58 you have those documents in evidence. and 10:58 they tell you, plain as day, that these two 10:58 defendants conspired with other cigarette 10:58 manufacturers. they created organizations. they 10:58 called them tobacco industry research committee; 10:58 changed the name to council for tobacco research; 10:59 spun off from that, the tobacco institute to be a 10:59 public relations arm. but those documents tell us 10:59 that they manipulated those cigarettes. 10:59 they took what mother nature gave them. they 10:59 take what -- they took what mother nature gave us 10:59 all, the tobacco plant. they exploited what was in 10:59 there, the nicotine. and they did so with the 10:59 intent to make a profit. they did not care a thing 10:59 about their customers, despite the promises they 10:59 made in 1953. 10:59 the first documents we showed you back friday, 10:59 a week and a half ago, were documents regarding 10:59 their efforts to market their deadly product to the 10:59 kids of this country. that was their intent, and 10:59 they hid it. 10:59 they recognized then that in order to keep 11:00 their business alive, they had to market to kids. 11:00 they peddled their cigarettes. they worked over 11:00 schools. they started that back in the 1920s. one 11:00 of the documents we showed you talked about summer 11:00 school. i believe you have it there on the screen. 11:00 kids were the replacement smokers. one thing 11:00 we know about mr. ramsay is by 1958, he was a 11:00 replacement smoker for somebody who either had quit 11:00 or somebody who had died. and the other thing we 11:00 know about mr. ramsay is in 1992, somebody else 11:00 became a replacement smoker for him. 11:00 we showed you the documents again that talks 11:00 about when kids started smoking. mr. ramsay was 11:00 one of those kids. 11:01 philip morris and r.j. reynolds knew back in 11:01 the '50s: you gotta hook the kids. you gotta get 11:01 the kids on cigarettes. that is the future of our 11:01 business. without it, we will dwindle. 11:01 that is what they intended to do, and their 11:01 documents prove they did it. i just want to take a 11:01 quick look at that. 11:01 younger adult smokers are the only source of 11:01 replacement smokers. they recognized back then, 11:01 looking back 50 years from the date of this 11:01 document in 1984, going back to 1934, that what 11:01 they had to do was they had to get kids smoking in 11:01 their teenage years. and if they did not, if they 11:01 waited until they were in their twenties, they 11:01 would not have a customer for life, plain and 11:01 simple. 11:02 you heard some evidence about this particular 11:02 document referencing the young adult market as 11:02 being those that are over the age of 18, 18 to 24. 11:02 i think you have seen plenty of other documents like 11:02 the one before you, where what they are really 11:02 talking about is the 14- to 24-year-old. some 11:02 documents even refer to them as being as young as 11:02 12. 11:02 the federal trade commission report that you 11:02 have in evidence actually noted that cigarette 11:02 advertising reaches kids as young as two. 11:02 i want to talk to you a few minutes about 11:02 something that -- i want to talk to you about 11:02 something that we showed you quite often during 11:02 dr. cummings' testimony. and it was a slide that 11:02 showed the rise of cigarette sales and the rise of 11:02 lung cancer. 11:02 and i want to remind you that the testimony 11:02 was that before the modern cigarette hit the 11:02 market, lung cancer was rare. it was very rare. 11:03 people did not suffer from lung cancer. it was not 11:03 until they got into blending and different tobaccos 11:03 and the different -- some of the different design 11:03 features and marketing that cigarette sales took 11:03 off. 11:03 well, by the 1950s, lung cancers were -- lung 11:03 cancer was skyrocketing. that is an epidemic 11:03 created solely by these two defendants and their 11:03 coconspirators. had they not done what they have 11:03 done, lung cancer would still be the rare form it 11:03 is back then. they created the epidemic of lung 11:03 cancer caused by cigarette smoking. 11:03 they talk about choices. bert ramsay sure 11:03 did not make the choice to create a lung cancer 11:03 epidemic. bert ramsay did not make the choice to 11:03 lie and conceal things from the american public. 11:03 we will talk a little bit more about what bert ramsay 11:04 did and some of his choices in a little bit. 11:04 you are going to get a verdict form. and so 11:04 what i would like to do for a few minutes is we are 11:04 going to go through this verdict form a little bit. 11:04 so one of the very first questions or the very 11:04 first question that you are going to have to answer 11:04 is whether or not mr. ramsay was addicted to 11:04 cigarettes containing nicotine and whether or not 11:04 that addiction was a legal cause of his lung 11:04 cancer. there is a whole lot going on in that 11:04 particular question. so i'm going to talk about 11:04 the different parts of that question individually. 11:04 the first thing here is legal cause. what is 11:04 legal cause? now, i know the court read to you the 11:04 definition of legal cause. you will have the packet 11:04 that he read from back there, to go back to and 11:04 read and figure this out. but there is a lot he 11:04 read to you. and those of us who do what i do, we 11:05 sometimes struggle with this concept of legal 11:05 cause. but i'd like to read it to you while you have 11:05 got it in front of you. 11:05 an addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine 11:05 is a legal cause of a disease or medical condition 11:05 if it directly and in a natural and continuous 11:05 sequence produces or contributes substantially to 11:05 producing such disease or medical conditions so 11:05 that it can be -- reasonably be said that but for 11:05 the addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine, 11:05 such disease or medical condition would not have 11:05 been suffered. 11:05 that is legal cause. 11:05 sometimes it is referred to as but-for cause. 11:05 you see that phrase in there. but here's the key 11:05 word. in order -- or the key part. 11:05 in order to be regarded as a legal cause of a 11:05 disease or a medical condition, an addiction to 11:05 cigarettes containing nicotine need not be the only 11:05 cause. 11:05 there are a lot of things and the law 11:05 recognizes there are a lot of things and a lot of 11:06 factors that come together to cause some event. 11:06 and when you have circumstances where there 11:06 are multiple things that come together to cause a 11:06 particular event, or in this particular case, lung 11:06 cancer and death, the law does not say only one of 11:06 those things can be the cause to the exclusion of 11:06 all others. 11:06 they could all be legal cause of lung cancer 11:06 and death. addiction to cigarettes only needs to 11:06 be one of them. and i think the evidence in this 11:06 case is overwhelmingly that mr. ramsay was addicted 11:06 to cigarettes. 11:06 another key word in there, that very first 11:06 sentence, "a legal cause." the word "the" is not 11:06 in there. "the legal cause" does not appear. "a 11:06 legal cause" is the key. 11:06 what i want to talk about this first question 11:07 on the verdict form for a minute, what that 11:07 question is not about. okay? see right here, 11:07 question is not whether robert ramsay had free 11:07 choice. that appears nowhere in the question. 11:07 the question is not whether robert ramsay was 11:07 unable to control himself. that is not it. 11:07 the question is not whether addiction took 11:07 over robert ramsay's life completely where he 11:07 could not quit, under no circumstances could he 11:07 quit. 11:07 the question is simply whether his addiction 11:07 was a substantial contributing factor, one factor 11:07 among many causes. and i think the evidence 11:07 supports that. 11:07 one of the things that we showed you from the 11:07 tobacco industry documents is how long ago they 11:07 recognized this importance and how hard -- how hard 11:07 it is for people, once they get them hooked to 11:07 cigarettes, how hard it is to quit smoking. 11:07 these documents you have before you are in 11:08 evidence. 11:08 happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is 11:08 both habituating and unique. most of those who 11:08 have smoked for any significant time would like to 11:08 stop. many, but not most of those who would like 11:08 to stop, are able to do so. 11:08 they knew it way back then. 11:08 what testimony did you hear from the witness 11:08 stand about mr. ramsay's addiction or whether or 11:08 not he was addicted? 11:08 clearly, you heard from dr. richard hurt. run 11:08 the mayo clinic for decades, the smoking cessation 11:08 clinic at the mayo clinic. dr. richard hurt told 11:08 you his opinion: he clearly was addicted. 11:08 he referenced something called the heaviness 11:08 of smoking index. you know, two main questions, if 11:08 you can only ask two questions, what are those 11:08 questions? 11:08 how much do you smoke per day? 11:08 and when do you have your first cigarette in 11:08 the morning? 11:08 mr. ramsay had his first cigarette in the 11:09 morning before he even got out of bed. had his 11:09 ashtray beside the bed. 11:09 mr. ramsay smoked at least, i think the 11:09 testimony is somewhere between a pack, a pack and a 11:09 half, to two packs per day for the bulk of his 11:09 life. 11:09 mr. ramsay had classic withdrawal symptoms 11:09 when he was trying to quit: the irritability, the 11:09 anxiousness, the frustration. 11:09 one of the things that i anticipate you will 11:09 probably hear during closing arguments is that, you 11:09 know, when mr. ramsay made the decision in 1988 to 11:09 quit smoking because he wanted to see his 11:09 granddaughter graduate from college, that he 11:09 started to stop smoking in front of his wife; he 11:09 stopped smoking in the house; he stopped smoking in 11:09 his office; he stopped smoking on the floor of his 11:09 office building; he stopped smoking in the whole 11:09 building. 11:09 your common sense, the judge has already told 11:09 you, you do not leave your common sense at the door. 11:09 you take it back there with you. 11:10 common sense tells you if mr. ramsay was not 11:10 addicted, why did not he just put the cigarettes 11:10 down and walk away? why did he have to go through 11:10 all those steps to finally get smoking under 11:10 control where he could quit? 11:10 it just does not make sense. common sense 11:10 tells you he was addicted. and that is not even 11:10 talking about the times on vacation and the other 11:10 times that his daughter talked about when he tried 11:10 to quit smoking and he would hide it. and you 11:10 could -- she could smell the smoke on him, even 11:10 though he is trying to quit. 11:10 dr. jack henningfield, the man who wrote -- 11:10 the man who wrote the book on nicotine addiction, 11:10 the surgeon general's report from 1988, told you, 11:10 by far, the most substantial reason why people 11:10 smoke at least a pack a day for -- of cigarettes 11:10 for years and decades, even in the face of health 11:10 concerns, is nicotine addiction. 11:11 he told you -- he described to you all the 11:11 different design features of cigarettes. he told 11:11 you how they manipulate nicotine levels. sure, 11:11 tobacco companies put less nicotine in it than it 11:11 appears in nature. but there is a reason for that. 11:11 the documents we gave you tell you that. 11:11 dr. henningfield told you that. the reason is 11:11 because nicotine in the natural level is too harsh. 11:11 it burns your throat if you smoke it. 11:11 kids cannot get hooked on it because they will not 11:11 smoke it. so what they do, they lower the nicotine 11:11 level. but we gave you a document where they 11:11 talked about: how low can we go? they want to get 11:11 rid of the harshness, so they had other ingredients 11:11 to it to match the harshness of nicotine. it makes 11:11 it so much smoother to the delicate respiratory 11:11 system of our children. 11:11 and it does not take long. just a little bit 11:11 of smoking and you are hooked, and you are hooked for 11:12 life. and for the rest of your life, you will have 11:12 those cravings. 11:12 they added things like licorice to allow it to 11:12 get deeper into the lungs. they added ventilation 11:12 holes to increase the smoothness of the smoke, all 11:12 the while, tinkering around and monkeying around 11:12 with whatever the nicotine level was so that they 11:12 could get the optimal level of it to keep people 11:12 smoking. otherwise, it would be like smoking 11:12 cigars. it would burn and you would not smoke them. 11:12 michael criscitiello, mr. ramsay's friend, 11:12 what was one of the last things he said to you? 11:12 mr. ramsay told me he was hooked. 11:12 annie bishop and jennifer hardman, his widow 11:12 and his daughter, talked about how he could not 11:12 stop. he tried, but he could not do it. 11:12 that is all evidence that you have that you use 11:13 to determine whether or not mr. ramsay was addicted 11:13 to cigarettes containing nicotine. 11:13 the other part of the question -- let us go 11:13 back to that question for a minute, baron. 11:13 the other part of that question has to do with 11:13 whether or not that was a legal cause of his lung 11:13 cancer. so we already talked about legal cause. 11:13 but let us talk about the lung cancer for a moment. 11:13 mr. ramsay had lung cancer. you have seen, you know, 11:13 gobbles of evidence that mr. ramsay had lung cancer 11:13 and he died from it. 11:13 i do not know how big of a dispute that is. 11:13 but clearly the medical records all show that he 11:13 had lung cancer. i believe -- where is that slide, 11:13 baron? 11:13 dr. villa -- i'm going to go up here where 11:14 dr. villa was. he stood up here on this witness 11:14 stand and told you these things. i think he 11:14 actually stood up here when he was asked these 11:14 questions about whether or not this was a primary 11:14 lung cancer. and he told you these things. 11:14 primary cancer of the lung because the 11:14 bronchoscopy saw the cancer in the bronchus. there 11:14 was some testimony about a skin cancer. but he was 11:14 flat out -- you know, that did not have anything to 11:14 do with his lung cancer. because if it did, it 11:14 would have appeared in a different part of the 11:14 lung, not inside the airway, inside the bronchus. 11:14 the pattern of metastatic disease to the 11:14 mediastinum is classical. classical. the 11:14 mediastinum, he told you about this area right here 11:14 in the middle, has all this stuff going on where 11:14 the lymph nodes are. 11:14 the pathology report says that keratinizing 11:14 squamous cell carcinoma is definitive. there are 11:14 no other suspicious primaries, meaning no other 11:15 suspicious tumors anywhere else in the body. 11:15 most importantly, all the specialists, the 11:15 treating doctors he had, agreed that this was 11:15 primary cancer of the lung and treated him like it 11:15 was primary cancer of the lung. you have a very, 11:15 very strong smoking history. you cannot have it any 11:15 better than that. that is what he said. 11:15 there is no doubt that mr. ramsay's lung cancer 11:15 was caused by smoking, and there is no doubt that 11:15 his lung cancer or his smoking was caused by 11:15 addiction to cigarettes. 11:15 i have a little chart here i would like to 11:15 show you about exposures, what mr. ramsay exposed 11:15 himself to. 11:15 one and a half to two packs per day, that is 11:15 10,950 to 14,600 cigarettes per year, every year he 11:15 smoked. the average is approximately ten puffs per 11:15 cigarette. that means that mr. ramsay, during the 11:15 course of his lifetime that he smoked, exposed his 11:15 lungs and washed his lungs with 69 different 11:16 chemicals that cause cancer, over -- roughly 11:16 4 million to 5 million times in the course of his 11:16 lifetime. 11:16 next slide, please. 11:16 let us take a look. addiction leads to the 11:16 continued smoking. he tried to quit. he tried to 11:16 quit. he tried to quit. there is some testimony 11:16 about, you know, he tried all these times on 11:16 vacation. but when the time he really made his 11:16 mind up in 1988, he really set his mind to do it. 11:16 that is some of the testimony, some of the argument 11:16 you will hear. 11:16 you know, they say insanity is doing the same 11:16 thing over and over and over and over again, 11:16 expecting the same -- a different result. well, in 11:16 mr. ramsay's case, he was a smart man. he tried 11:16 everything he could. he tried to quit at times 11:16 when he had the family's support. he tried to quit 11:16 at times when it was not as stressful for him at 11:17 work. and he failed at it. 11:17 everything else in life he was successful at. 11:17 he failed at it. then he tried nicorette gum. and 11:17 he failed at it. and then he tried the things that 11:17 we have already talked about, controlling his 11:17 environment. and you know what? that finally 11:17 worked. he was finally able to get off cigarettes. 11:17 the question is, is why did not he try it 11:17 before? who knows? but the point is, is 11:17 mr. ramsay was smart. he looked at it. he 11:17 evaluated his own condition. and he did things he 11:17 could to try to help himself quit. and one of them 11:17 finally worked. 11:17 the only problem is, it was just too late for 11:17 mr. ramsay. 11:17 addiction leads to the continued smoking, 11:17 which leads to the continued exposure of 11:17 carcinogens, which leads to the lung cancer which 11:17 finally killed him. 11:18 so the answer to question number one clearly 11:18 is a yes. his addiction to cigarettes is what 11:18 caused him to smoke for all those years. and 11:18 without his addiction, he would not have developed 11:18 lung cancer. and that was testimony from 11:18 dr. villa. 11:18 once you get through the first question and 11:18 answer yes that he is -- then he is a class member. 11:18 that is -- that is -- that is your determination, that 11:18 he is a class member. 11:18 then you have got some more questions to ask. 11:18 but those engle findings that you have been told 11:18 about, that smoking causes lung cancer and nicotine 11:18 is addictive, that the tobacco companies concealed 11:18 material information from the public, that they 11:18 conspired with one another to conceal material 11:18 information from the public, all those become 11:18 binding on you. they become binding on us. they 11:18 become binding on them. they become binding on the 11:18 court. they are set in stone once you get to that 11:18 point. and they apply. 11:19 so what you are going to get to is the next 11:19 questions after the first couple of questions about 11:19 whether or not smoking cigarettes caused his lung 11:19 cancer and death. you are going to get to those 11:19 questions that evaluate their conduct. now you are 11:19 going to start to really look at what they did. 11:19 and let us talk about what they did for a little 11:19 bit. 11:19 oh, before i leave that, that is a good point. 11:19 dr. henningfield gave you something that i think is 11:19 very beneficial. he gave you the definition of 11:19 addiction, that when he was at the national 11:19 institute of drug abuse, nida, i wrote it, but he 11:19 told it to you from the stand: chronic relapsing 11:19 brain disease characterized by compulsive use, 11:19 often in the face of harm. 11:19 chronic relapsing. he tried to quit and he 11:19 went right back. he tried to quit; he went right 11:19 back. that is chronic relapsing. 11:20 brain disease, you heard all about that from 11:20 dr. henningfield, about the nicotine receptors, how 11:20 the nicotine goes in there, causes the release of 11:20 the chemicals that make you feel good. 11:20 characterized by compulsive use. if not 11:20 smoking 50 to 60 packs [sic] of cigarettes per day 11:20 is not compulsive use, then that -- there is no such 11:20 thing. 11:20 in the face of harm. you know, we are not 11:20 saying that mr. ramsay was an idiot and stuck his 11:20 head in the sand and lived under a rock. there is 11:20 stuff out there. people knew -- people suspected 11:20 smoking caused disease. people knew that smoking 11:20 at least -- whether they knew about how addictive 11:20 it was, not sure about that, but they at least knew 11:20 that it was definitely at least very hard to break; 11:20 that once you start it, it was difficult. 11:20 did mr. ramsay know that? yeah. his conduct 11:20 tells us that he perceived some of that. that is 11:20 not the point. that is not the point. we will get to 11:21 that in a minute. 11:21 i do not believe you heard any other evidence 11:21 other than that the cigarettes manufactured by 11:21 philip morris and r.j. reynolds caused his 11:21 continued smoking and his eventual lung cancer and 11:21 death. 11:21 so let us go back to the question i was getting 11:21 to. and this question has to do with -- let us go 11:21 past that. there we go. 11:21 these questions have to do with whether or not 11:21 mr. ramsay relied on what they were putting out. 11:21 now, what we have is we have a conspiracy claim, 11:21 and we have a concealment claim. the concealment 11:21 claim is based on material information that they 11:21 withheld, that they did not tell the people about. 11:21 and they showed, i do not know, countless 11:21 reader's digest articles and time and newsweek 11:21 articles about what was being said about cancer and 11:22 smoking. you did not hear a single bit of evidence 11:22 that mr. ramsay ever read one of those magazines. 11:22 but let us talk about what was out there. 11:22 there was some research being conducted that showed 11:22 cigarette smoking caused lung cancer. we showed 11:22 you those. i passed you around the life magazine 11:22 article that you looked at. dr. wynder and 11:22 dr. graham painted the tar on the backs of mice in 11:22 the early '50s, and they developed tumors. so this 11:22 got a wide range of publicity. 11:22 and what happened? let me see the consumption 11:22 slides real quick, baron. 11:22 what happened when it got all this publicity? 11:22 we have shown you this before, but let us take a look 11:22 at it again. 11:22 right here, in the 1950s, very sharp -- i 11:22 cannot draw on this one, can i? right there. very 11:22 sharp drop in cigarette sales. why? people were 11:23 worried about the health risks. so what do the 11:23 tobacco companies do? they do not come out and say, 11:23 you know what? you are right. we have got this book 11:23 report. remember it had been characterized as a 11:23 book report? we have got this book report written by 11:23 one of our young scientists who studied, i think, 11:23 reference '78, '79 article or something like that 11:23 that linked cigarette smoking to lung cancer. they 11:23 did not come out and say, we know this; let us figure 11:23 out what we can do to make them better. they 11:23 did not just sit back and keep quiet and let the 11:23 doctors do their work and figure it out. 11:23 no. they attacked them, called them fanatics. 11:23 the same people that took the stand in this case, 11:23 dr. henningfield, dr. cummings, dr. hurt, their 11:23 predecessors were attacked by these two defendants 11:23 and the other conspirators because they were trying 11:23 to get the truth out. every chance they had, they 11:23 went on the offensive. 11:24 but that was not enough. that was not enough. 11:24 they had to go and they had to give people that 11:24 psychological crutch: filters. in the 1950s -- 11:24 you heard some of the statements. if we -- there is 11:24 nothing in there that is injurious to health; but if 11:24 there is, we will take it out with filters. 11:24 and what happens to the rise of cigarette 11:24 sales? 11:24 put that back up. 11:24 what do we know now? filters were a gimmick. 11:24 they do not work. but the tobacco company sold it 11:24 as the latest and greatest. and people by the 11:24 millions switched to them, so much so that with, i 11:24 think, 2 percent of the filters in the '50s were -- 11:24 early '50s were filtered to, by the time you get to 11:24 the surgeon general's report in '64, 90-something 11:24 percent of them were filtered, i think. you will 11:24 remember whatever the percentages are. 11:25 people bought it, hook, line, and sinker. and 11:25 all the while, they are sitting back there counting 11:25 the dollars that that just made them. 11:25 they do not work. they did not work then, and 11:25 they do not work now. 11:25 and they knew it. 11:25 but it does not stop there. finally, you get 11:25 to the 1960s when you have the question asked of 11:25 president kennedy. he does not even know the full 11:25 link between smoking and cancer. and they want 11:25 bert ramsay to know the full extent of it? 11:25 so what happens two weeks after his speech, 11:25 his answer? you have the commission of the surgeon 11:25 general's committee; and then you have the 11:25 follow-up, which is the surgeon general's report, 11:25 the very first one, the 1964 report. and it got so 11:25 much publicity. 11:25 cbs news, one of the only three networks at 11:25 the time, had a special on it, a two-hour special. 11:25 and we showed you portions of that clip. defendant 11:25 showed you portions of that clip. 11:25 what happens to cigarette sales? they drop. 11:26 what do they do? they go on the offensive, 11:26 and they start developing these lights and low-tars 11:26 and low-nicotine brands, all the while knowing it 11:26 does not work. they gave them another psychological 11:26 crutch. 11:26 lights and low-tars do not work. they are not 11:26 low-nicotine, low-tar. they knew it. they knew 11:26 that the smokers were getting bad information from 11:26 those machine tests. and they sat right back and 11:26 let it happen. and they marketed on that. that is 11:26 why you see some of the advertising, advertising 11:26 the ftc method, you know, 11 milligrams tar, 11:26 .9 milligrams nicotine. 11:26 but we showed you their own internal documents 11:26 where they were reverse-engineering one another's 11:26 products. or at least r.j. reynolds's was 11:26 reverse-engineering merit. where they recognized 11:26 that the amount of nicotine that the smoker was 11:26 getting from the low-nicotine/low-tar brand was 11:27 actually more than the winston. 11:27 and then going back to winston, you heard 11:27 dr. cummings tell you: when bert ramsay switched 11:27 from camel unfiltered to winston filters around 11:27 1960, he switched to a brand of cigarettes that was 11:27 giving him two and a half times the amount of 11:27 carcinogens than he was getting with the unfiltered 11:27 camel. 11:27 they knew it. they had researched it, and 11:27 they knew it. 11:27 that, ladies and gentlemen, is a material 11:27 fact. 11:27 would bert ramsay have acted differently if 11:27 he would have known switching to what he perceived to 11:27 be a safer cigarette was, in fact, actually two and 11:27 a half times more dangerous for him than the 11:27 current one he was smoking? would that have made a 11:27 difference to him? absolutely. 11:27 he did just what they wanted him to do when 11:27 they wanted him to do it. and that was what you 11:27 heard from dr. cummings. 11:27 to the defendants, bert ramsay was a success 11:27 story. the only problem with it is he did not live 11:27 long enough to make them more money. 11:28 so when you are looking at this question, you 11:28 have the same legal cause issue to deal with when 11:28 you are talking about concealment. 11:28 so the concealment that they did, this was the 11:28 type of information. not that they withheld the 11:28 fact that smoking causes lung cancer. people were 11:28 recognizing that. and people like dr. henningfield 11:28 and dr. hurt and dr. cummings were trying their 11:28 hardest to get the truth out. but you heard 11:28 dr. henningfield even say it himself. i was 11:28 bamboozled. the whole government was bamboozled by 11:28 this light, low-tar, filter stuff. 11:28 those are the material facts that were 11:28 withheld, that filters do not work, that lights and 11:28 low tars do not mean lights and low tars, that 11:28 you are really getting just as much as you were 11:28 before. 11:28 and then they started with the -- carrying on 11:28 into the 1980s, the open controversy. they had 11:29 been spreading this controversy message since 1953. 11:29 they challenged the people who were coming out and 11:29 speaking about how, you know, there is this link 11:29 between smoking and disease, and they challenged 11:29 them and they attacked them. 11:29 you heard the -- you saw the video from 11:29 mr. dwyer in 1979. you remember the video we 11:29 showed you where he is standing up there in front of 11:29 the curtain. he must have 50 or 60 microphones in 11:29 front of him. and the first thing out of his mouth 11:29 is, it was suspect from the start. 11:29 he is attacking the surgeon general's report. 11:29 the people who were trying to get the truth out, 11:29 get smoking rates down, get lung cancer rates down. 11:29 no mercy for these people. they brought all their 11:29 resources to bear to attack every chance they 11:29 could. all the while, giving their customers a 11:29 reason to keep smoking. 11:30 every time bert ramsay tried to quit, they 11:30 intercepted that. they intercepted it with a 11:30 gimmick. do not quit, go to the filters. do not 11:30 quit, go to the low tars. and it killed him. bert 11:30 ramsay's dead because he believed what he heard. 11:30 let us take a look at that question, the 11:30 concealment question. 11:30 please state whether mr. ramsay reasonably 11:30 relied to his detriment on any statement by 11:30 r.j. reynolds tobacco company that concealed or 11:30 omitted material information concerning the health 11:30 effects and/or addictive nature of smoking 11:30 cigarettes. and if so, whether such reliance was a 11:30 legal cause of his death. 11:30 there is that legal cause thing in there again, 11:30 that but for. it does not have to be the only 11:30 cause. it does not have to be -- sure it is not the 11:30 cause that you have to establish. 11:31 their decision, their choice, they want to 11:31 talk about choices, their choice to lie about what 11:31 filters do and what filters do not do, their choice 11:31 to lie about low tars and low nicotine, their 11:31 choice to attack the surgeon general, to try to 11:31 make this an open controversy. 11:31 by the way, you will see that in the question. 11:31 but 1982, may 5th, 1982, the open controversy that 11:31 the chairman of the board of r.j. reynolds -- we 11:31 showed you the clip of him on nightline, this, can 11:31 we have an open debate about smoking, that is 1984. 11:31 he is still trying. these defendants are still 11:31 trying to convince people there is some question 11:31 about smoking and health. 11:31 and there is no consensus. you heard it from 11:31 the witness stand. there was no consensus -- or 11:31 there was no dispute about the consensus. all the 11:31 doctors, all the scientists were convinced smoking 11:31 causes cancer. 11:31 the only body out there saying otherwise are 11:31 these companies, but you heard how much they do. 11:31 they spend more in one day than the public health 11:32 community could get out in a whole year. 11:32 so did mr. ramsay rely? absolutely. you can 11:32 refer -- or you can infer from all the wallpaper 11:32 that dr. cummings talked about, all the wallpaper 11:32 advertising and all the programs, all the 11:32 commercials, the project truth. remember the 11:32 gentleman coming down the halls of congress talking 11:32 about these respected doctors who testified at the 11:32 91st congress, that there is -- there has not been 11:32 proven there is a link between cigarettes and 11:32 smoking. 11:32 but what you also heard from dr. cummings is 11:32 how those respected scientists were bought and paid 11:32 for by ctr funds, the special projects. 11:32 so did he rely? sure, he did. his behavior 11:32 is consistent with the fact that he relied. 11:32 r.j. reynolds and philip morris put out there, 11:32 filters are safer. and when they did it, he 11:33 followed. they put out there that lights and low 11:33 tars were safer. and when they did it, he 11:33 followed. a success story for these two defendants 11:33 that dr. cummings talked about. 11:33 let us go to the frank statement, please, 11:33 baron. 36. that is what i have. 11:33 how much time? ms. cherry: thirty-nine minutes, mr. clark. 11:33 mr. clark: okay. thank you. 11:33 you remember the frank statement. we showed 11:33 it to you a few times. it is in evidence. you will 11:33 be able to see it. 11:33 this was their promises in 1954 when this was 11:33 published. you will remember the story about when 11:33 stock prices fell, the cigarette companies met. 11:33 fierce competitors. did not do stuff like this 11:34 before then. but this was such a blow to their 11:34 business when stock prices started to fall, that 11:34 they locked arms and decided to meet. 11:34 and what did they meet? they meet for one 11:34 purpose. they are going to figure out a way to make 11:34 a public relations campaign and create doubt, and 11:34 the tobacco industry research committee was the -- 11:34 was the result of that meeting. and here's what 11:34 they said. 11:34 they made these promises. so from the very 11:34 first day that -- after they started to agree that 11:34 they can -- they are going to attack this stuff, 11:34 they are not going to take this lying down, they 11:34 start with this controversy, that medical research 11:34 of recent years indicates many possible causes of 11:34 lung cancer. 11:34 that is contradictory to what claude teague 11:34 said in that memorandum in r.j. reynolds 11 months 11:34 before. but that claude teague memorandum was not 11:34 released with the frank statement. 11:34 there is -- that -- there is no agreement 11:35 among the authorities regarding what the cause is. 11:35 dr. cummings said that was not true. 11:35 that there is no proof that cigarette smoking 11:35 is one of the causes. there is ample proof. and 11:35 they knew it. they knew it. 11:35 those three statements were lies, and they 11:35 knew it then. 11:35 we accept an interest in people's health as a 11:35 basic responsibility paramount to every other 11:35 consideration in our business. the evidence has 11:35 been overwhelming that the only thing they cared 11:35 about was money. money, money. how can they get 11:35 more of it. 11:35 there is a document in evidence that we showed 11:35 to you that you can look at. i believe it is 11:35 dr. teague also, talks about how if the exit gates 11:35 to their market, meaning if people were able to 11:35 quit smoking and get off cigarettes, many of them 11:35 would. and if the exit gates open, they would be out 11:35 of business overnight. 11:36 all they cared about was the survivability of 11:36 their business. they did not care about the health 11:36 of their consumers. 11:36 we believe the products we make are not 11:36 injurious to health. another lie. the problem is, 11:36 people did not really know that then. 11:36 we always have and always will cooperate 11:36 closely with those whose task it is to safeguard 11:36 the public health. no, they did not. no, they 11:36 did not. not once did they cooperate. you heard 11:36 some testimony about the tobacco working group and 11:36 how they talked about cooperating with the national 11:36 cancer institute to kind of figure out how to make 11:36 a safer cigarette. 11:36 what you have in evidence is the rest of the 11:36 documents regarding that, where they are basically 11:36 telling each other that we are going to stay in the 11:36 tobacco working group because we need to protect 11:36 the industry. 11:36 let us go to the -- this question's not 11:37 about -- likely addiction question, the class 11:37 membership question. this question is not about 11:37 some things as well. 11:37 the question is not whether the defendants 11:37 could have said something that would have made him 11:37 stop smoking, although it would have sure helped if 11:37 they would have told him the truth about the 11:37 filters and the low tars. 11:37 whether information on harms of smoking was 11:37 available. it was out there. you know, all the 11:37 reader's digest and stuff like that. 11:37 whether robert ramsay ever saw a warning. you 11:37 know, that is not part of this question. 11:37 the question is whether or not there is false 11:37 controversy, that idea that there is an open debate 11:37 about smoking, that doctors just are not sure, that 11:37 there is other possible causes other than 11:37 cigarettes, whether that was a substantial 11:37 contributing factor, one among many causes. 11:37 did they expect -- let us go to the heimann 11:38 slide. did they expect their consumers to rely on 11:38 it? we played you the video deposition of one 11:38 robert k. heimann, formerly the chief executive 11:38 officer of american tobacco, now part of reynolds. 11:38 and we gave you his testimony. would you 11:38 expect the consumer to rely upon your 11:38 advertisements? yes. our advertisement is 11:38 truthful, and we would anticipate that they would 11:38 rely on it if they chose. 11:38 and you heard dr. cummings talk about the 11:38 wallpaper of advertising. it was everywhere, 11:38 television, print, newspapers, billboards, movies. 11:38 there was not a single place that cigarette 11:38 advertising did not occur. 11:38 i believe one document you had shows that it 11:38 was the most heavily advertised product in america. 11:39 how do we know filters were a gimmick? they 11:39 said it themselves. the illusion of filtration is 11:39 as important as the fact of filtration. 11:39 not only that, public health community, you 11:39 heard them, they were -- dr. henningfield, they 11:39 were expecting the lung cancer rates to go down. 11:39 but they did not. they did not. why? 11:39 finally, finally, when documents like these 11:39 get released, we finally find out why. when 11:39 dr. henningfield wrote the 1988 surgeon general's 11:39 report, he did not know -- he himself did not know 11:39 everything that they knew. and this man worked for 11:39 c. everett koop, the surgeon general, testified 11:39 before congress several times. he did not know all 11:39 that they knew. 11:39 and when that information came out, it made a 11:40 difference to him. would it have made a difference 11:40 to mr. ramsay? 11:40 you heard a little bit of testimony about this 11:40 pneumothorax. you heard a little bit of testimony 11:40 about this pneumothorax, about how he did not smoke 11:40 while he was in the hospital. what you also heard 11:40 was he was -- he had a tube stuck in his chest to 11:40 inflate his lung, and he was on some very powerful 11:40 pain medication. 11:40 so the follow-up to that came when mrs. bishop 11:40 was asked whether or not the doctor told her 11:40 husband whether smoking caused his pneumothorax. 11:40 and i believe the testimony was, he said it could 11:40 have. 11:40 does not really matter what the testimony was, 11:40 whether he said it could have, whether he said he 11:40 did not think it did. it is the unequivocal 11:40 statement that it was definitely caused by smoking. 11:41 that is what she was looking for. that is the 11:41 important thing. 11:41 all the rest of the stuff was kind of wissy -- 11:41 wishy-washy. maybe it did, maybe it did not. it 11:41 could have, i'm not sure. those kinds of things. 11:41 let us look at the tobacco and health research 11:41 procedural memo. 11:41 who was the target audience for this 11:41 particular document? doctors and scientists. and 11:41 if you will remember, the tobacco and health research 11:41 memo was this publication that they would send to 11:41 doctors giving other reasons why smoking was not the 11:41 cause of certain diseases. one of the headlines 11:41 said, "large birth causes cancer." those are the 11:41 kinds of things they were sending to doctors and 11:41 scientists. 11:41 this document, 1968, bert ramsay's 11:41 pneumothorax in the early '70s, '74, maybe. what 11:41 are they sending to these doctors? 11:41 let us go to that, down at the bottom there. 11:42 the most important type of story is that which 11:42 casts doubt on the cause-and-effect theory of 11:42 disease and smoking. 11:42 i asked dr. cummings why would you want to 11:42 send that to doctors. because you get it to the 11:42 patients. 11:42 the evidence is clear. i'm going to wrap it 11:42 up here. 11:42 the evidence is clear that these companies 11:42 figured out ways to make cigarettes the addictive 11:42 product that it became. they manipulated around 11:42 with the nicotine levels. they added ingredients 11:42 to make it easier to inhale. the easier it is to 11:42 inhale, the quicker the nicotine gets to the brain, 11:42 and you promote addiction by that means. 11:42 in addition to doing these things in secret, 11:42 what they also were doing in secret was taking a 11:43 look at -- taking a look back and seeing just how 11:43 effective their 50 years of lying and 11:43 deceitfulness, how effective that really was. 11:43 for nearly 20 years -- this document's in 11:43 evidence for you to read. for nearly 20 years, 11:43 this industry has employed a single strategy to 11:43 defend itself on three major fronts; litigation, 11:43 politics, and public opinion. 11:43 while the strategy was brilliantly 11:43 conceived -- they call themselves brilliant. they 11:43 had the nerve to make a product like they make, lie 11:43 to people about it, addict people, addict children, 11:43 make profits off of it, lie to them, and then blame 11:43 them for killing them. have the nerve to call 11:43 themselves brilliant. 11:43 and they concede and executed over the years, 11:43 helping us win important battles. it is only fair 11:43 to say that it is not, nor was it intended to be a 11:44 vehicle for victory. on the contrary, it has 11:44 always been a holding strategy consisting of 11:44 creating doubt about the health charge without 11:44 actually denying it. advocating the public's right 11:44 to smoke without actually urging them to take up 11:44 the practice. 11:44 that is the intervention. that is when 11:44 mr. ramsay's trying to quit. they say, no, you 11:44 do not need to quit. you have tried to quit. it is 11:44 too hard. go to these safer cigarettes. these 11:44 filters will take out stuff. these low tars will not 11:44 give you as much chemicals. 11:44 it is a lie. it was a lie. clearly, their 11:44 conspiracy and their concealment was a legal cause 11:44 of why bert ramsay died. without it, he would not 11:44 have. 11:44 that continued over into the 1980s with that 11:44 open debate campaign. it continued over into the 11:44 1980s with the vantage advertising. 11:44 i want to remind you just a couple of moments 11:45 of some of the testimony you heard, and then i'm 11:45 going to wrap it up soon. 11:45 dr. cummings. mr. ramsay was a model case of 11:45 the success of the industry's public relations 11:45 efforts giving smokers a psychological crutch and 11:45 self rationale to keep smoking. 11:45 he went from unfiltered to filtered 11:45 cigarettes, from filtered cigarettes to low-tar 11:45 cigarettes, just as the internal business records 11:45 of the defendants in this case wanted. he was a 11:45 success case in their view. 11:45 that is what dr. cummings testified to the 11:45 other day right before he was finished. 11:45 dr. henningfield. from a public health 11:45 perspective, the problem was they created the 11:45 illusion of a safer cigarette. i know the federal 11:45 scientists were as bamboozled as i was when i 11:46 started my research in the late '70s. we thought 11:46 less was less. we did not know that smokers were 11:46 not getting significantly less. 11:46 when dr. raffa finished testifying yesterday 11:46 morning, that chair was empty. somebody from the 11:46 tobacco companies could have came and told you 11:46 whether or not all the information dr. cummings and 11:46 dr. henningfield said -- 11:46 mr. walker: objection, your honor. 11:46 the court: come up for a second. 11:46 (a discussion is had on the record at sidebar 11:48 as follows: 11:48 the court: thank you. 11:48 mr. walker: your honor, i object to this 11:48 argument asking the jury to draw some sort of an 11:48 inference from the fact that a witness was not 11:48 called to testify. it is not an appropriate 11:48 argument under the case law. 11:48 mr. clark: it is fair comment to comment on 11:48 the fact that a party does not show up and explain a 11:48 material issue. we have case law on that. 11:48 it is not fair comment to comment on a witness 11:48 who is equally available to the -- to both sides. 11:48 but it is definitely fair comment to comment 11:48 on the fact that a party does not show up and say 11:48 something. 11:48 the court: yeah. equal availability, i 11:48 thought, was the test. this is always 11:48 uncomfortable. but i think that is the test, is 11:48 someone equally available. 11:48 mr. walker: he is talking about reynolds' 11:48 scientists. they are equally available to them. 11:48 there is testimony that they designated people on 11:48 the witness list, i think they could have called. 11:48 they did not call a scientist from reynolds to 11:48 address these issues. so i mean, there is some 11:48 cases. there are plaintiffs who put testimony in 11:48 they took on behalf of the scientist, whether it 11:48 was philip morris or anyone else. 11:48 the court: okay. well, if the argument is 11:48 that someone was not called to rebut something, i 11:48 think that is probably fair game. i understand, and 11:48 i think we have got the record. we will overrule the 11:48 objection. 11:48 (the sidebar discussion was concluded.) 11:48 mr. clark: like i was saying. somebody from 11:49 r.j. reynolds or philip morris could have came and 11:49 sat in that seat and told you that what 11:49 dr. cummings said was not accurate. 11:49 somebody could have came and told you that 11:49 these design features that dr. henningfield talked 11:49 about, the vent holes and the overwrap, the burn 11:49 accelerants and how they affect smoking, they could 11:49 have came and told you that was not what they were 11:49 doing. 11:49 but you did not get any of that. not a single 11:49 word. all you got was a bunch of articles about 11:49 what mr. ramsay may have known. 11:49 the questions are kind of similar, the 11:49 conspiracy and the concealment questions. so the 11:49 answer is clearly yes. their lies, their deceit, 11:49 and their cover-up caused bert ramsay's cancer and 11:49 death. they could not have done it alone. the 11:49 companies had to work together. that is your 11:49 conspiracy. 11:49 the only other question i want to talk about 11:49 on the verdict form is the question of 11:49 responsibility and fault. 11:49 after you get done with those questions, 11:49 you will be asked to assess how much mr. ramsay's at 11:49 fault, how much is r.j. reynolds at fault, how much 11:49 is philip morris at fault for causing this. 11:50 and you have heard, we have admitted that 11:50 mr. ramsay bears some responsibility. tried to 11:50 quit smoking. could have done it more. could have 11:50 done it better, could have tried harder. he is got 11:50 some fault in this, no doubt. 11:50 but they have got more. they have got more 11:50 because their superior knowledge, their 11:50 advantageous position, and their lies and deceit is 11:50 what led him to this. 11:50 so what you have is you have several entities 11:50 that you have been presented with. you have been 11:50 presented with r.j. reynolds, philip morris, ctr, 11:50 and the tobacco institute. and then you have bert 11:50 ramsay. 11:50 so the total has to equal a hundred percent. 11:50 so the only fair way i see it is give everybody 11:50 twenty percent. twenty percent to mr. ramsay, twenty percent 11:50 to r.j. reynolds, twenty percent to philip morris, but 11:50 they are responsible for the conduct of ctr and ti 11:50 because that was their organizations so they got to 11:50 bear that twenty percent on each one of them as well. 11:51 so i think a fair amount here would be 11:51 forty percent for reynolds, forty percent for philip 11:51 morris, and twenty percent for mr. ramsay. 11:51 ms. cherry: you have 55 minutes, mr. clark. 11:51 mr. clark: thank you. 11:51 from that frank statement, back in 1954, they 11:51 made promises they never intended to keep. they 11:51 attacked the surgeon general. they put profits 11:51 over people. and for the next 39 years that 11:51 mr. ramsay lived, they duped him, the public health 11:51 community, and the government, and anyone else who 11:51 dared to speak the truth. 11:51 these witnesses testified a lot. you heard 11:51 about all the different trials, how many trials 11:51 they have been testifying in. and you heard them 11:51 talk about why they do it. dr. henningfield told 11:51 you, this is a way i can get the truth out. this 11:52 is how i can educate people on what is going on. 11:52 i bet none of you in here knew, coming into 11:52 this courtroom two weeks ago, what you know now. 11:52 and dr. henningfield and dr. cummings told you that 11:52 20, 30, 40 years ago, they did not know it either. 11:52 but yet mr. ramsay somehow is supposed to be blamed 11:52 for what he did. 11:52 the choices made were mostly theirs. i'm 11:52 going to sit down now and let mr. berg have a few 11:52 minutes. but i thank you for listening to me. and 11:52 you will not have to hear me anymore. i'm all done. 11:52 thank you. 11:52 thank you, your honor. 11:52 closing argument 11:53 mr. berg: ladies and gentlemen, i want to 11:53 thank you on behalf of not just myself and 11:53 mr. clark, but ms. bishop. i think all the lawyers 11:53 in this room are going to tell you that you have been 11:53 one of the most attentive, question/answer asking 11:53 juries that we have ever had the pleasure to try a 11:53 case in front of. 11:53 we know you have been engaged. you have been 11:53 listening carefully, thinking about these issues, 11:53 and obviously trying to do the right thing in this 11:53 case. 11:53 you know, we have got this huge sign up here in 11:53 this beautiful courtroom about equal justice under 11:53 the law. and that phrase is used in other 11:53 countries. it is on other courtrooms. but they 11:53 make fun of it in other countries. the citizens 11:53 laugh about that because it is a joke. 11:53 but in our country, we take it seriously. 11:53 jurors like yourselves take it seriously, that they 11:54 come into a courtroom, there is no special interest, 11:54 there is a level playing field. we listen to the 11:54 evidence and have people from all walks of life 11:54 come together and come up with the right decision 11:54 and do justice under the law. 11:54 and so in this case, we are going to ask that 11:54 you, as this jury, stand up to these corporations, 11:54 to these companies, these tobacco companies, and 11:54 tell them with your verdict that we are not going to 11:54 tolerate, we are not going to stand for intentional 11:54 misconduct that destroys lives, that destroys 11:54 families. 11:54 you have heard about the 20 million families and 11:55 individuals that have been killed by these 11:55 products. and i want to get to it in a minute. 11:55 but i want to touch on one other thing first that 11:55 came up because, you know, we put on six days of 11:55 evidence of some of the most world-renowned 11:55 scientists and experts in these fields for you to 11:55 listen to, ask questions of, and testify. 11:55 and what we got from these two defendants was 11:55 a two-minute clip out of two full days of 11:55 deposition testimony of ms. bishop. that -- and 11:55 that was it. that is their rebuttal to the evidence 11:55 that you have heard. 11:55 we know that they have the capability to find 11:56 experts, to bring in qualified scientists -- 11:56 mr. walker: objection, your honor. 11:56 the court: sustained. can you just move on. 11:56 mr. berg: so i want to talk about what that 11:56 clip showed because that clip -- you heard a little 11:56 bit about this before, but that clip is really 11:56 important to the plaintiff's case in this matter. 11:56 i want to talk about it for a minute. 11:56 this collapsed lung -- and there is been a lot 11:56 of questions, a lot of discussion, a lot of 11:56 testimony about it. the collapsed lung is a 11:56 critical piece of evidence in this whole case. 11:56 it frames this case because what it tells us 11:56 is that ms. bishop, the reason she was upset with 11:56 the doctor at the time was because whether it was 11:57 caused by smoking or not, she wanted him to tell 11:57 her husband that it was caused by smoking. she 11:57 wanted there to be no doubt in mr. ramsay's mind 11:57 that smoking caused that collapsed lung, even if it 11:57 did not, so that he would quit. 11:57 and why do we know that that is so true and so 11:57 powerful? because the evidence in this case, the 11:57 evidence that these defendants did for 50 years was 11:57 create doubt. was create uncertainty. was create 11:57 a rationale for a smoker to keep smoking. the 11:57 whisper in the ear of, you can switch, you do not 11:58 have to quit, you are not going to die next week or 11:58 next month or next year. 11:58 they created the rationalization and denial 11:58 that addicted people cling to. it is not a 11:58 character flaw to be addicted. but they cling to 11:58 that self rationale, that rationalization. 11:58 and what addicted people need is certainty. 11:58 they need the information that tells them, you are 11:58 at rock bottom, or there is no doubt you are going to 11:58 die, or there is no doubt you are going to lose your 11:58 relationships or your life. 11:58 they need that to motivate to quit, to execute 11:59 on the quits, to follow through on the quits. 11:59 and that is why she wanted so badly for that 11:59 doctor to look him in the eye and say, what you 11:59 just went through felt like a heart attack, you are 11:59 in the hospital for two weeks while a tube's in 11:59 your lung reinflating it, that is from smoking, 11:59 mr. ramsay. she wanted that to be crystal clear. 11:59 no doubt, no self rationale, no denial, no 11:59 rationalization. 11:59 and what do we know about his addiction? that 11:59 the minute the doctor did not say those things, he 11:59 went right back. he went right back. he relapsed. 12:00 and you have heard that that is part of addiction, 12:00 relapsing, even in the face of harmful 12:00 consequences. 12:00 now, since this case is about bert ramsay and 12:00 about his wife, let us talk for a minute about him. 12:00 because you heard nothing bad about bert ramsay in 12:00 this case. 12:00 he was a good student, worked hard at it, 12:00 finished college, went into the military, served 12:00 admirably, stood face to face with 12:01 president kennedy presenting the troops, went to 12:01 work for a corporation that he spent his entire 12:01 career at, that he was loyal to, that he was the 12:01 kind of father that all the evidence you heard in 12:01 this case was they ate meals together, they did 12:01 things together, they went on vacations together. 12:01 they had a model family, loving, supporting. 12:01 you heard the pain from daughter, jennifer, 12:01 just thinking back about witnessing some 12:01 lighthearted dancing in the kitchen, i think she 12:01 was talking about, with her mom and dad as she 12:01 would see kind of from a distance, and those images 12:01 and memories of them and their relationship. 12:02 he was a good friend to people, like mike 12:02 criscitiello, and others. and although they 12:02 relocated a number of times, they uprooted from 12:02 their friends that they had developed, annie bishop 12:02 and mr. ramsay, they always had each other. they 12:02 had each other. they were best friends. they 12:02 talked about everything. they did things together. 12:02 you heard from jennifer about how she saw her 12:02 mother kind of lose her spark after mr. ramsay's 12:02 death. you know, his -- bert ramsay's life 12:02 mattered. it mattered to annie. it mattered to 12:03 his family and friends. and it mattered in the 12:03 same way that 20 million other deaths caused by 12:03 smoking mattered to their families. 12:03 so what was the evidence about bert ramsay's 12:03 character? again, nothing bad or unfavorable. he 12:03 did the right things. he played by all the rules. 12:03 played by all the rules to do the right thing. 12:03 but what about the character of r.j. reynolds 12:03 and philip morris? you know, your parents and your 12:03 teachers and your pastors, they tell you that 12:04 character is what you do when no one's watching. 12:04 mr. walker: objection, your honor. 12:04 the court: overruled. 12:04 please continue. 12:04 mr. berg: and what did these companies do 12:04 when they did not think anybody was watching? was 12:04 it -- what was it that they were doing in secret? 12:04 because that is where they were telling the truth to 12:04 each other. not what they were going to tell to 12:04 the public. but we know the truth was coming out 12:04 in their secret, confidential memos and discussions 12:04 going on. 12:04 and that is the nature of the character of 12:04 these defendants. they want to be, and the law 12:04 treats them as people. not corporations, as 12:04 people. the same rights, the same obligations. 12:04 there is a lot of information you see and a lot 12:05 that you are going to see in the documents and the 12:05 records. and you are going to have to ask yourself, 12:05 is there anything that you have been shown that shows 12:05 any kind of concern on the part of these defendants 12:05 for the american public? any concern for the 12:05 health and safety of any of their own customers, 12:05 people like bert ramsay? 12:05 and in his openings statements, mr. walker, 12:05 and i'm sure in his closing, will say things to you 12:05 like, when bert ramsay was motivated to quit, he 12:05 quit. 12:06 and my question to you is: when were these 12:06 men of tobacco, when were they motivated to quit? 12:06 motivated to quit lying to the public about the 12:06 relationship between lung cancer and smoking? 12:06 motivated to quit about the addictiveness of 12:06 nicotine that they knew about and hid from the 12:06 public? motivated to quit this 50-year conspiracy 12:06 from which none of them broke ranks, that killed 12:06 20 million of their best customers for using the 12:06 product exactly the way they intended it to be 12:06 used. 12:06 so your verdict cannot bring bert ramsay back. 12:07 and the time for sympathy and apologies is long 12:07 gone. so we are here in this courtroom. there is no 12:07 surprise. we have talked about it from the 12:07 beginning. you understand that this case is about 12:07 what drove these two corporations and others all 12:07 those years. what they made every decision based 12:07 on, and that was profits, money. and today, under 12:07 our system, the only way for your verdict to do 12:07 justice in this case is to award money damages. 12:07 now, again, the unrebutted testimony that you 12:07 heard from the economist, dr. raffa -- and like any 12:07 of the testimony, you decide, you heard, you may 12:08 think that there is things that were not properly 12:08 considered or that should be looked at differently. 12:08 but his testimony was that there were several 12:08 levels, and he talked about the support and the 12:08 services, the net accumulations that were losses to 12:08 ms. bishop. 12:08 and you may recall that his -- his numbers 12:08 were for the present value of the loss of support 12:08 that she would have received. again, bert ramsay, 12:08 he had really gone up the chain. he was making a 12:08 good living. 12:08 and so the amount of money that the evidence 12:09 has shown that would have been the present value, 12:09 this is minus the pension that she was entitled to 12:09 that you heard about for loss of support to her, 12:09 was $792,716. and then the loss of services to her 12:09 was $123,055. 12:09 and then in addition, he talked about the net 12:09 accumulations to the estate. and that was the 12:09 amount that, after they had spent for various 12:09 living expenses, approximately seventy percent of the 12:09 income that he made, that there would be this 12:09 remainder that would be the savings expected over 12:09 the course of his life. 12:09 and so that figure of the net accumulations to 12:09 the estate was $778,623. 12:09 the total was $1,694,394. 12:10 and that is a significant figure. that is a 12:10 significant figure. and on your verdict form, 12:10 you will see there are questions eight and nine, 12:10 those are the net accumulations, and then the 12:10 support and services figures. and actually, that 12:10 support and services is added together. so that 12:10 figure of the $792,716 plus the $123,055, that 12:10 total which would be on that line, number nine, on 12:10 the verdict form, is $915,771. 12:10 but despite the significance of that, the 12:11 human loss, the human loss in this case, which goes 12:11 to the next question, to the amount of damages 12:11 sustained by annie bishop for the loss of her 12:11 husband's companionship, for her pain and suffering 12:11 as a result of robert ramsay's injury and death, 12:11 that is significant too. that is significant too. 12:11 and there is no exact figures for that. 12:11 there is no precise calculations. it is evidence 12:11 that you, as the jury, decide is fair and just in 12:11 light of all the evidence. and that is the 12:11 instructions that you heard. 12:11 so you are going to have to struggle through 12:11 that question on your own to try to figure out what 12:11 you think is fair and reasonable. 12:11 we can give suggestions or suggest what we 12:12 think the evidence has shown in relation to the 12:12 amount of the economic damages. we are suggesting 12:12 that the figure for her loss of companionship, and 12:12 pain and suffering for these past 22 years should 12:12 be $5 million. and that the evidence supports 12:12 that. 12:12 if you think that is too high, then you adjust 12:12 it accordingly. if you think it is too low, you 12:12 adjust it accordingly. that decision is yours to 12:12 make. 12:12 because you are going to have to ask, what is it 12:12 worth to lose your best friend, what is it worth to 12:12 lose the father that you see interact with your 12:12 children, who were in their twenties at the time, 12:12 what is the value and what is the worth of seeing and 12:12 experiencing the death, not having the interaction 12:13 with the grandchildren that you have heard about and 12:13 seen in this case. what is it worth to lose your 12:13 husband, the only man that you have been with since 12:13 you were 17 years old, 31 years, and he -- they 12:13 were both just 51 when he died. 12:13 ms. cherry: you are at 20 minutes, mr. berg. 12:13 mr. berg: thank you. 12:13 what is it worth to have your lasting images 12:13 seared in your head of your son carrying your 12:13 husband because he cannot walk, his body's ravaged 12:13 by cancer, and those final days and months and how 12:13 quickly he went. 12:13 finally, you are going to be asked in this 12:14 case, on the final question, to determine whether 12:14 punitive damages are warranted in this case. 12:14 damages that are meant specifically to punish the 12:14 actions, the conduct, the behavior of these two 12:14 defendants. and that is question number 11. 12:14 you heard the instructions for that. and 12:14 what is interesting about those instructions on the 12:14 punitive damages is that you are asked to consider, 12:14 by the clear and convincing evidence, that did 12:14 their conduct -- and i'm not reading the entirety 12:14 of this, so rely on the instructions that you have 12:15 with you or will be provided to you. but that 12:15 show, number one, a reckless disregard of human 12:15 life or the safety of persons. they obviously did 12:15 that, the evidence has shown. 12:15 number two, that their conduct has been 12:15 consciously indifferent to the consequences. that 12:15 is certainly true. 12:15 number three, their conduct has wantonly or 12:15 recklessly disregarded the safety and welfare of 12:15 the public. we know from the evidence that that is 12:15 proven by the clear and convincing evidence. 12:15 and number four, that the conduct showed such 12:15 reckless indifference to the rights of others as to 12:15 be the equivalent to an intentional violation of 12:15 those -- those rights. 12:15 you will see in that -- in that series of 12:15 questions that between each of those four is -- 12:16 four elements is the word "or." you only have to 12:16 decide that the clear and convincing evidence 12:16 established one of those things. and it is clear 12:16 that all four have been met in this case. 12:16 and in conclusion, these -- these defendants, 12:16 they did what they did knowing that people were 12:16 going to die, that people were dying, and they kept 12:16 on doing it. and that is the kind of conduct that 12:16 warrants punitive damages in a way to punish them 12:17 and to deter others. 12:17 so in this courtroom, ladies and gentlemen, 12:17 you have the power. you have the power to right a 12:17 wrong. you have the power to tell these two 12:17 defendants that that type of conduct is not going to 12:17 be tolerated. 12:17 and so we would suggest to you, as i asked you 12:17 in opening, that it is a case about truth and what 12:17 these defendants did to the truth. and it is a case 12:17 about consequences. and we are asking that they 12:17 face those consequences today with your verdict. 12:17 thank you. 12:18 mr. berg: thank you, your honor. i was -- i was interested to see that photograph with the fork in the road because i think it made clear in this case what you have heard about the fork in the road that the tobacco companies had the choice about back in 1953. back in 1953, when there was the cancer scare came out and they all locked arms and went to the plaza hotel, where they began this 50-year conspiracy, it was at that point where they could have taken the right direction. they could have taken the direction of being upfront, telling the truth, disclosing the information that they already knew about, and that they were learning about, or they could take the road that they chose. and they took the road to conceal, to lie, to create this cover-up and conspiracy that would last for the next 50 years. mr. walker made a lot of comments about specific things that the tobacco companies did not say. and yet, this case is equally about the omissions, the things they did not say that they knew about. so, they knew that smoking caused lung cancer. and they made a conscious effort to create doubt about that, to never really completely deny it: possibly we will look into it, it needs more research, we are not really sure, we are going to try to find out. did they know that nicotine was addictive early on? yes, they did. and no, they did not come out and say nicotine's not addictive. but they knew it was addictive and they never came out and told the american public when they knew that it was. what could have happened? what could have happened if they had done that simple thing: tell the truth about the addictiveness of nicotine back in the early 60s, late '50s, when they knew about these things? we have already seen what the modern markets do. what modern medicine has done with patches and lozenges and nasal sprays and other -- chantix and wellbutrin and dependency clinics. we have already seen those things come into being that have given a lot of addicted smokers the ability to quit. the ability to say, hey, it is not just me, it is not just a character flaw, that i cannot quit. i know i cannot quit, but now that people would learn that it is an addictive substance, that it is addictive like heroin or like cocaine and that you have got to treat it in that way, you have got to treat getting off of it, with some people, like mr. ramsay, you have got to treat it in that kind of way that you would treat another addictive substance. and so instead of -- you have seen these graphs of the consumption chart and the cancer chart. so instead of that chart, that graph, just escalating, escalating and escalating and then does it turn. you have all seen it come back down. you have seen it come back down. why does it come back down? it is come back down for several reasons. one is, a lot of the people of burt ramsay's era -- we have talked about this -- where smoking was everywhere, three out of four men of his era were smokers. so we are finding that as it goes up, that era, those people are dying. and so there is some decrease related to that. there is some decrease based on modern medicine and what is happening in terms of nicotine replacement and therapies that way. but probably the most important thing is -- is as we sit here in 2014, people know, they know what the problem with cigarettes is. there is no ambiguity about it. there is no doubt, no uncertainty, people in this era know about the addictiveness and they know about the disease-causing manner of -- of smoking. so with all that and with that knowledge, that graph is coming back down. it is coming back down. and that could have happened 50 years earlier. fifty years. and, yeah, mr. walker's upset that i've said 20 million people. well, that is 20 million folks with hopes and dreams and aspirations just like -- just like mr. ramsay. they are not just points on a graph. they are not just statistics for the tobacco companies to keep track of. they are real human beings. and if we are doing this 50 years earlier, that is a lot of american lives, a lot of american families that are saved. now, mr. walker got up here, i thought they must not have ever cross-examined any of our witnesses that we put up there the way he was talking. if they thought dr. villa was such a great witness, which, of course, he was, why were they so determined to try to cross-examine him and get him to say things that smoking did not cause the lung cancer; that it was not primary; that he did not have this information; that he did not do an autopsy, et cetera? but why did not they just come in here and say, of course smoking caused his lung cancer. we are not contesting that. but no, they had to spend their 45 minutes pulling out other depositions and parsing words with dr. villa when it was obvious that dr. villa was saying, without any doubt, this gentleman has primary lung cancer, it is caused by smoking, and that is the cause of his death. period, end of story on that. but no, we did not get that. and then now dr. hurt is all of a sudden -- they are going to pull out some words from his testimony to suggest that somehow he supports their arguments in this case? dr. hurt testified that mr. ramsay was severely addicted. there was no question about that. that he looked at him with all the evidence, all the deposition transcripts, all the medical records, based on his 25 years at the mayo clinic and the tobacco dependency aspect. hundreds and hundreds of peer-reviewed articles and lectures in public health on smoking and tobacco cessation. he talked about that heaviness of smoking index. he said, that is not the only thing i looked at. that is not the only thing i based it on. but if i was to use one test, if i had to, if there was one test to determine addiction, that is the best one. that is the one that they teach medical doctors to use. they teach referring doctors to use. they teach their own consultants at the mayo clinic to use. so that is a -- a test, but it is not the only thing. you heard him talk about the quit attempts. you heard him talk about some spontaneous pneumothorax and what that meant as far as addiction and how clear that was for addiction. he does not say that the minute the nicotine is physically half-lifed out of your body that all of a sudden the nicotine-addicted smoker has no more desire, has no more relapsability to go back to smoking. he said nothing like that. he talked about the cravings, the triggers, the cues, to return and to relapse are there for months and even years with some people. but at least months. and so that is -- that is a very powerful indication of -- of the power that nicotine held over this gentleman; that he could return. that he would risk his own health; that he would risk or somehow self-deny, rationalize, whatever words we want to call it, somehow his family in order to return to nicotine. that was a clear indication of his addiction. now, on that first question, about addiction, there is no question there about whether he could have quit, should have quit. is it fault? might have been at fault, any of that. that comes later on the verdict form. that question about allocation of fault comes later down on the verdict form. in that first question, that is not part of the question. it is simply: was he addicted to nicotine in the cigarettes, and was that a legal cause of his lung cancer and death? was it a substantial contributing cause, his addiction? and not an insignificant cause? was it something that substantially contributed to him continuing to smoke and develop the lung cancer? and all the evidence in the case, all the testimony that you heard, all of it said "yes" to that question. there is nothing other than their implication, their speculation on the other side that he was not addicted. all the testimony from the witnesses is that he was hooked; that he could not stop; that he could not quit; all the language of addiction. dr. hurt, dr. henningfield, there -- there was nothing in rebuttal to that. so that -- that first question is clear. that is unambiguous; that he was addicted and that that was a legal cause. now, if you want to decide later on -- and we have admitted that he bears responsibility, bears some responsibility. and we have not shirked from that at all. it is shared responsibility. so if you want to answer that question down below, then that is where that is appropriate to address that. the other thing that mr. walker talked about was -- and you are going to see this. you are going to see these engle findings again, and what is -- what is important about these is that when you answer the question on addiction, when you answer that first question, that he was addicted and it was the legal cause, when you answer that question "yes," these findings have already been determined. they have already been determined. now, mr. walker spent an hour up here talking about bits and pieces of different conduct, suggesting that their conduct really was not that bad; really was not negligent; really was not concealing; was not fraudulent. but the problem with that, ladies and gentlemen, is that the engle findings have already determined this. if this was a year-long trial where you -- they heard more evidence than anything compared to what this is -- mr. walker: objection, your honor. the court: hold on one second. sustained. mr. berg: you are going to get all this evidence in the case. please look through it carefully. there is a lot there. the surgeon general reports in their entirety are there to be looked at. all these different records from which pieces have -- have been shown for benefit of time, they are all in there. go through those records carefully, carefully yourself. take the time to look at them and see what they have to say. but these engle findings have already been established. and the first couple we have talked about and so there is not much issue at all. no. 3: the finding is, "r.j. reynolds and philip morris were negligent." so we know that is been established. no. 4: "r.j. reynolds and philip morris placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous." that is established. no. 5: "r.j. reynolds and philip morris concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available, knowing that the material was false and misleading, or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects and/or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes." so we are being told this as having been determined that they concealed and omitted material information that was not otherwise known to the public or to burt ramsay, and that is been determined by the engle findings that you have been instructed with the answer to burt ramsay being a class member. mr. walker: objection, your honor. the court: hold on one second. mr. walker: objection. the court: overruled. mr. berg: and then no. 6: "that r.j. reynolds and philip morris entered into an agreement to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers and the public would rely on this information to their detriment." again, these matters are all established already in this case once you find class membership. mr. walker spent quite a bit of time attacking the public health experts that came and testified in this trial, attacking dr. henningfield, who you remember did the cigarette dissection. attacking dr. cummings, attacking dr. hurt. and, you know, this -- these defendants, they spent 50 years attacking the public health community. mr. walker: objection, your honor. the court: overruled. mr. walker: (inaudible). mr. berg: so we heard them go after these people and impugn their integrity. you know, they are mercenaries, they are generals in the public health war. well, if they are mercenaries, then we need more mercenaries. we need more folks looking out for the public health of american citizens. quitting, like any addiction, quitting an addiction does not mean you were not addicted. people with addictions quit. they are able to. they do it, they struggle to do it. some struggle more than others. but the fact that someone struggles and tries and tries and ultimately quits is -- is now being suggest ed that it -- if that happens, if they do that, if they make those efforts and if they are ultimately successful, that means they were never addicted in the first place. you did not hear anything like that in this trial from any of these witnesses. nothing like that, even close to the argument that if you are able to quit, you are not addicted. mr. walker seems to feel that the evidence that came from the witness stand about the brain of young people of adolescent and how it is affected by drugs such as nicotine, that somehow that meant that the minute a person turns 18, they do not have those changes anymore. the minute they turn 21, they do not have those changes anymore. that is not what the evidence was. the evidence is the brain is still forming, and these drugs make their changes in that time frame to teenagers and kids and because of that, their addiction tends to be more severe and long-lasting into adulthood. not the minute they turn 18, all of a sudden it is a brand-new ball game. there is no witnesses or testimony that said what he seems to be suggesting. these -- these issues with the filters, and the low tar, you were shown a statement from dr. henningfield that dr. henningfield said -- his testimony was, when he made that statement about low tar or filtered being better in his opinion than unfiltered, that was before he knew. that was before he knew. so mr. walker's clipped out that testimony when dr. henningfield said, that was before we got millions of pages of documents that had previously been secret in the late '90s. and before that, we thought maybe it was. he was almost embarrassed that he, as a significant member of the public health community, had been bamboozled. that was his word. he was truly embarrassed by the fact that the public health community had been defrauded and fooled in the same way that the american public had been, in terms of filters and low tar. so low tar. let us talk about that for a minute. what does -- what -- what does any reasonable person think when the term "low tar" comes out and it is used by the companies in the way that it was used? is it anything other than it is safer? is there any commonsense interpretation that it is anything other than safer, wink, wink, whatever you want to call it? they were very careful. they were very specific not to say "safer," but what did they want the american public to believe? what did they want the smoker to believe? that it was safer. safer to go that route than to quit, safer to switch, go to the low tar; and mr. ramsay, who was knowledgeable, well-read, intelligent, he -- he tracked along with exactly that model. he was -- he was a success story of the tobacco companies. when filters came out, he went there. when low tar came out, he went there. when this new-fangled filter that is on that vantage ad, that commercial, can that ad mean anything other than that -- that they are representing that that filter is somehow going to purify or take bad things out of tobacco? can it have any other connotation to the american public? of course not. it is meant to communicate more safe. it is meant to communicate healthier. and that is exactly what they did, for years and years and years. you know, they -- we saw a lot of reader's digest in this trial. but what was interesting to me was that these executive officers of these tobacco companies, they must have never read reader's digest. they must have never read those articles, because every time they made a public statement, every time they were in the press, on tv, on a news show, asked about it, in response to the public health, every single time, they said, it does not cause cancer. we are not aware of it being addictive. but the american public is supposed to know all those things. the american smoke -- smoker is supposed to know all those things. why would they spend 200 -- you know, these -- these companies they do not spend money stupidly. they do not waste money. and they spent 200 billion dollars on advertising over the course of burt ramsay's life. 200 billion dollars to communicate these different claims and filters and low tar and different brands of their cigarettes. and they did it because it worked; because we see the consumption scale just keep going up during that whole time. it worked. ms. cherry: 25 minutes. mr. berg: there is a -- i'd like to run a short compilation of some of the ads that you have seen -- or some of the press statements that you have seen in this case. (on video.) * * * * male speaker: (inaudible) this is a (inaudible) of one of the major producers. i am dr. robert dupuis, chairman of the technical group of the tobacco industry research committee. (inaudible) and so far we have not. we are removing from smoke and still retain the pleasure of your favorite cigarette. i do not believe that most people who smoke get lung cancer. we have smoking habits. this is another incidental (inaudible). we want (inaudible), just as much as the surgeon general did and will cooperate in every way. when you say there is something toxic about tobacco or (inaudible) removal by filter? well, obviously (inaudible) i do not think (inaudible) admits there are any bad elements. throughout our entire history the surgeon general, the a.m.a. (inaudible). and the outcome, it will be removed. we have no program that i know of to try to help people to stop smoking. we do talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous. we do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous. we do not accept that. as a manufacturer of the world's biggest-selling cigarette, are you concerned that the world health organization said that cigarettes are the cause of a worldwide epidemic because you see at present, kills hundreds and thousands of smokers every day? male speaker: am i concerned? i'm concerned i've considered the possibility (inaudible). i'm concerned that people make claims, including those against our products, without adequate knowledge. there has not been the sort of research (inaudible) cigarette to be able to say. male speaker: it was suspect from the start. atw secretary (inaudible) launched his antismoking campaign a year ago with all the zeal of a reformed sinner. and now in an apparent attempt to bring some science to the side of his new evangelism, the former three-pack-a-day secretary told the surgeon general, prepare a new report. (music) we asked philip morris, r.j. reynolds, brown & williamson and lorillard to appear on this program. none would. they told us to talk to the tobacco institute. the institute sent anne browder to speak for them. female speaker: the jury has not come in. male speaker: it may not be harmful. you are not convinced. female speaker: it may be or it may not be. male speaker: you are saying that smoking does not cause cancer? yes or no? male speaker: it is not known whether cigarettes cause cancer. that has not been causally established. male speaker: cigarette smoking, no causal relationship between cigarette smoking and emphysema? male speaker: despite all of the research to date there has been no causal link established. male speaker: no causal relationship between cigarette smoking and heart disease? male speaker: no. as a matter of fact, there are studies that while we are accused of being associated with heart disease, there have been studies conducted over ten years that would say again that science is still puzzled over these forces. that is (inaudible) arbitrarily placed here by american tobacco institute? male speaker: no, it is not. male speaker: would you put that warning (inaudible) male speaker: no. male speaker: (inaudible.) male speaker: certainly do. male speaker: you do not think the kind of smokers who we believe -- our product is not injurious to health (video concluded.) * * * * mr. berg: the warnings that were placed at the beginning of the -- the caution in 1966, which was a cautionary warning, burt ramsay had already been a smoker for almost ten years at that point. a regular smoker. by the time it went to 1970 and there was a warning that it was dangerous, he switched to -- to low tar. and he already had been a smoker for well over 12 years at that point, an addicted smoker. our burden of proof in this case is the greater weight of the evidence. it is a slight tipping of the scales. it does not mean you cannot have any questions. it does not mean you cannot have any doubts. it just means that the evidence that you hear and that you decide, you feel as though it weighs more, it persuades more, it makes more common sense. and that is the burden of proof in a civil case, which is what we are here on today. i have two last things to say to you and then i'm going to sit down. the -- mr. ramsay, he had -- the evidence in this case is that he had a right to know, he had a right to know about the additives being placed in these cigarettes. he had a right to know that and make a full, informed choice, that he did not have that information. and he would have and should have been able to have that information. you are going to hear that the -- and you have heard that the tobacco companies acknowledged that the argument about free choice -- and you have seen this document or heard it referred to a couple of different times -- that their own internal documents have indicated that. . . and this was the tobacco institute memo in september of 1980, where there -- they indicate the lawyers remind us -- i'm told -- that the entire matter of addiction is the most potent weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer cigarette case. we cannot defend continued smoking as, quote, free choice if the person was addicted. lastly, these companies, as evidenced by the document from william dunn in october of 1977, we mentioned this in opening statement, that these companies looked at the addicted smoker, their own customer, as nothing more than a rat in a cage. put a hungry rat in a cage, put a lever in the cage, make it so that it pushes on the lever it delivers a pellet of food, consider the smoker smoking the cigarette as the lever press, the effect of that smoking act upon his person is the reward, that effect reinforces the smoking act. he comes to push the lever 10 to 60 times per day. without the chemical compound nicotine, the cigarette market would collapse; philip morris would collapse; and we would all lose our jobs and our consulting fees. i want to thank you, again, for your -- your -- your attention and your sacrifice in this case. if you -- as you go through the jury instructions and you follow those -- those carefully, um, it will lead you to a just decision in this case, and we look forward to that. thank you.
