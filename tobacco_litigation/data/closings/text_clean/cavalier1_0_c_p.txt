22 mr. chestnut: good afternoon, jurors. on 23 behalf of the entire group of plaintiffs, on behalf 24 of mrs. fanali, on behalf of mrs. cavalier -- who is 25 on the back row there, sitting back there, gorgeous lady one over from the back -- we want to 2 thank you. it is been almost three weeks. you have 3 been very attentive. we just need a few more 4 minutes of your time, perhaps one more day for 5 punitive damages, to encapsulate all the evidence 6 you have heard, because you have heard so much. 7 but it all boils down to this, ladies and 8 gentlemen. it is simple: lie, deny, and blame the 9 smoker. lie about the harmful effects of smoking, 10 deny that smoking is addictive, and blame the 11 smoker. 12 members of the jury, this is america. we love 13 it. you can do anything. you can be jay z. you 14 can be jay from around the corner. you can be 15 beyoncé or you could be bea from the beauty salon. 16 you could apply pressure, defy pressure. it is 17 limitless. 18 but as a company, there are limitations, 19 because as a country, we have a conscience, and 20 it is that conscience that separates us from the 21 rest of the -- 22 mr. persons: objection, your honor. it is 23 improper, conscience of the community. 24 the court: conscience of the community, just 25 do not reference that. you are fine otherwise. that is fine. 2 mr. persons: motion. may i approach? 3 the court: okay. sure. of course, 4 mr. persons. 5 before the 6 court at the bench and out of the hearing of the jury.) 7 mr. persons: this will save some time. 8 the court: that is fine. yes. 9 mr. persons: what i'd like to do so that i 10 do not have to jump up here every time is when -- 11 mr. gary: you do not have to scream the 12 objection. 13 the court: we are fine. 14 mr. persons: well, instead of having to come 15 up here and move for a mistrial, which is what i'm 16 going to do now, i will simply say "motion." 17 the court: okay. 18 mr. persons: that way i do not have to come up 19 here and do this. 20 the court: okay. that is fine. okay. that is 21 fine. is that acceptable to the plaintiff? 22 mr. chestnut: that is great. 23 mr. gary: yeah, that is good. 24 mr. persons: and of course i'll move -- 25 the court: at this point, i'm going to deny it, but i'll sustain your objection. 2 mr. persons: thank you. 3 in open 4 court before the court and jury.) 5 mr. chestnut: members of the jury, the rules 6 for a company are simple. you can make all the 7 money you want to make, a million, a billion, $10, 8 but you cannot sacrifice the safety of americans 9 for profit. 10 a tobacco company, including rjr, must not 11 intentionally produce a defective cigarette knowing 12 that the toxin, the chemical compound in this 13 cigarette, is toxic to humans and is likely to 14 cause deadly disease in the americans that purchase 15 that cigarette. 16 mr. persons: objection; preemption. 17 the court: overruled. 18 mr. chestnut: an industry, the tobacco 19 industry, must not conspire amongst itself, plot to 20 intentionally conceal from the american government 21 and the american public the harmful effects of the 22 cigarettes they sell and the addictive nature of 23 the cigarettes that they sell. 24 members of the jury, we are going to go through 25 some evidence, and as we do that, i'd just ask you do one thing for me, and that is, remember that the 2 reality of mr. cavalier is different. the reality 3 of this case is different. 4 this case is really set in the 1930s and '40s. 5 when mr. cavalier was a teenager and was targeted 6 by the tobacco companies, there was not the 7 organization called truth. teenagers did not know 8 about the harmful and deadly effects of smoking. 9 in fact, tobacco companies were advertising that 10 smoking was not only safe, it was healthy. 11 mr. cavalier's reality in the 1930s and '40s, 12 and '50s, the reality of the public in the 1930s 13 and '40s and '50s, was wholly diametrically opposed 14 to what we know today, and that was by design, 15 because the tobacco company conspired, the tobacco 16 industry conspired, to lie, deny, and blame the 17 smoker. 18 let us go to 1955, ladies and gentlemen. the 19 plaza hotel, a group of tobacco executives get 20 together. they are meeting about the future of 21 their industry. they are meeting to plan on lie, 22 deny, and blame the smoker. 23 here's a document, ladies and gentlemen. it 24 says: for nearly 20 years, this industry has 25 employed a single strategy to defend itself on three major fronts: litigation, politics, and 2 public opinion. it has always been a holding 3 strategy consisting of creating doubt about the 4 health charge without actually denying it -- 5 they are talking about smoking -- advocating the 6 public's right to smoke without actually urging 7 them to take up the practice. on the litigation 8 front, for which this strategy was designed, it has 9 been successful. 10 what are they conspiring to do, ladies and 11 gentlemen? they are conspiring to make billions of 12 dollars selling a drug. they say the future, the 13 future, we have an emerging picture of a fast, 14 highly pharmacological, effective and cheap drug -- 15 this is their internal document, ladies and 16 gentlemen -- drug called tobacco. 17 now, why is it so important for them to lie 18 and deny the addictive nature of tobacco? we will 19 get to it in some slides later. 20 ms. schneider: objection, your honor. may we 21 approach? can you pull that down, please? 22 the court: sure, ms. schneider. 23 ms. schneider: that is not in evidence. 24 the court: mr. acosta did not put that in 25 evidence. chestnut: i think he is moving it into 2 evidence. 3 the court: is it coming in? 4 ms. schneider: we still have argument on it, 5 your honor. 6 the court: that is denied. let us go. 7 defendant's objection is denied. let us go. 8 in 9 open court before the court and jury.) 10 mr. chestnut: before starting on the future 11 scenario let us look at what we are currently 12 selling and how it is developed. 13 "a cigarette as a drug administration system 14 for public use has a very, very significant 15 advantage." 16 here's, in essence, what they are trying to 17 say, ladies and gentlemen. i'll sum it up for you. 18 mr. persons: object to the interpretation of 19 the document. 20 the court: overruled. 21 mr. chestnut: it is argument. 22 the court: overruled. 23 mr. chestnut: thank you. 24 the cigarette companies are selling a drug. 25 the drug is nicotine. in america, the government regulates drugs as either illegal or legal. you are 2 either in the illegal drug trade or you are in the 3 legal drug trade. 4 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 5 the court: overruled. 6 mr. chestnut: if you are in the illegal drug 7 trade, if you get caught, you are going to jail. if 8 you are in the legal drug trade, ladies and 9 gentlemen, you are regulated by the fda. and that, 10 ladies and gentlemen, is what they were trying to 11 avoid. 12 the tobacco companies, although they are 13 selling nicotine, they know it is addictive, they 14 know it is going to freebase. it is addictive as 15 crack. freebase is what pookie did in new jack 16 city. 17 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 18 the court: overruled. 19 mr. chestnut: it is freebase. it is a drug. 20 drugs that are this strong, as strong as nicotine, 21 are regulated by the federal drug administration. 22 they do not want the government regulation, and so 23 they conceal it. not only do they conceal it, they 24 conspired to conceal it by putting it in tobacco 25 seeds. it says: "tobacco is a relatively efficient 2 nicotine delivery system." 3 this is their documents, not me, it is them. 4 "the effect of nicotine on the brain is to 5 increase the level of arousal. different people 6 smoke cigarettes for different reasons, but the 7 primary reason is to deliver nicotine into their 8 bodies. similar organic" -- this is them comparing 9 the drug they are selling to other drugs. 10 they say: "similar organic chemicals include 11 nicotine, quinine, cocaine, atropine and morphine. 12 while each of these substances can be used to 13 affect human physiology, nicotine has a 14 particularly broad range of influence." 15 a cigarette -- 16 ms. schneider: your honor, take that down, 17 please. may we approach? 18 the court: that is fine. 19 objection sustained; the bottom portion of 20 that document. i saw it. just the bottom portion. 21 objection sustained. 22 just crop the bottom portion. thank you. 23 mr. chestnut: thank you. 24 it is a tobacco document, internal, ladies and 25 gentlemen, says: "a cigarette is the perfect pleasure. it is exquisite, and it leaves one 2 unsatisfied." 3 this starts talking about addiction. 4 "what more can one want? let us provide the 5 exquisiteness and hope that they," meaning the 6 american public -- 7 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 8 the court: overruled. 9 mr. chestnut: -- the american public, "that 10 they, our consumers, continue to remain 11 unsatisfied" because, members of the jury, the more 12 you remain unsatisfied, the more cigarettes you 13 buy. kind of like when you buy four to six packs a 14 day for 50 years like thomas cavalier, the more 15 you are unsatisfied, the more you buy. 16 "the attitude of men must directly deal with 17 the industry is that is what is interesting and 18 important for us to understand, that is why the 19 notes of our four interviews and research are given 20 at some length." 21 here's where we get into addiction. 22 one of the men, these are tobacco employees 23 and execs saying, one of the men said, "it is 24 fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they," 25 meaning the american public, "cannot break." another one said, "boy, would not it be 2 wonderful if our company was the first to produce a 3 cancer-free cigarette? what could we do to the 4 competition?" 5 members of the jury, all this time we are 6 spending arguing about causation, they knew as an 7 industry way, way back, as my grandma would say, 8 way back yonder, that this causes cancer. they are 9 thinking about how can we produce a cancer-free 10 cigarette. they did not do it. 11 suppose everybody smoked just one cigarette 12 less a day. that would be maybe $40 billion a 13 year. 14 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 15 misstates the evidence. 16 the court: overruled. 17 mr. chestnut: suppose everybody smoked just 18 one cigarette less a day. that would maybe be $40 19 billion a year. 20 mr. persons: same objection. 21 the court: overruled. 22 mr. chestnut: the smokers seeks the 23 subjective state that results from the introduction 24 of nicotine into the bloodstream. 25 ms. schneider: your honor, may we approach? court: sure. 2 before the 3 court at the bench and out of the hearing of the jury.) 4 ms. schneider: this is not in evidence. 5 it is not part of the conspiracy. it is hearsay. 6 the court: okay. mr. chestnut, it is a pm 7 document. 8 mr. acosta? 9 mr. chestnut: your honor, this goes to prove 10 conspiracy. 11 the court: wait, wait. 12 ms. schneider: you only use what is in 13 evidence in closing. 14 the court: was there any objection to this 15 one? 16 mr. acosta: which one is this? 17 mr. chestnut: your honor, i'll move on. 18 the court: he will move on, okay. 19 in open 20 court before the court and jury.) 21 the court: you may continue, mr. chestnut. 22 mr. chestnut: remember, ladies and gentlemen, 23 these are tobacco documents. tobacco documents, 24 not documents we made up, these are documents that 25 the tobacco companies hid and concealed as part of the conspiracy. they never thought that you would 2 see it. they never thought the public would see 3 these internal documents. 4 and so on a lot of them, you will see this, 5 "confidential." now, the themes, i'm going to go 6 through the slides, members of the jury, and if 7 you will just go with me, all right. watch the 8 themes. 9 the first theme is this. tobacco, when you 10 see a confidential document, they admit, you will see 11 an admission in that document that tobacco is 12 harmful and that it is addictive. when you see a 13 public document or a document that is for release, 14 it will say the opposite, that tobacco is not 15 harmful, that it is not addictive. 16 "we must in the near future provide some 17 answers which will give smokers a psychological 18 crutch and a self-rationale to continue smoking." 19 members of the jury, this is an ad from the 20 '40s and '50s where they have doctors and 21 advertising that doctors smoke. more doctors smoke 22 camels than any other cigarette. so what tobacco 23 is telling the public, that their product must be 24 safe, it must not be addictive because doctors are 25 smoking it, but they know the opposite. you can count on cigarette companies who have 2 obligated themselves to pour millions of dollars 3 into cancer research to take anything out of your 4 cigarette that is a health hazard. if our science 5 ever really finds any such hazard in the wonderful 6 tobacco leaf -- this is a public document. go back 7 to the private document. 8 "it has been our holding strategy to create 9 doubt about the health charge without actually 10 denying it." 11 they do not admit anything. they just say, if 12 we find that it is harmful, we will do something 13 about it. that is not true. it is a lie. lie, 14 deny, blame the smoker. 15 here, ladies and gentlemen, the tobacco 16 companies take on the surgeon general's report. 17 clearly, the report issued by the surgeon general's 18 office today is politically rather than 19 scientifically motivated. 20 now, is this déjà vu or what, because 21 yesterday when dr. w flew all the way from santa 22 monica -- 23 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 24 mr. chestnut: he is a witness who testified. 25 they hired him. persons: objection. 2 the court: overruled. 3 mr. chestnut: thank you. 4 so he flew all the way from santa monica, 5 california. he was the guy that testified in two 6 tobacco trials the same day for tobacco. 7 when i asked him -- remember he said, "i 8 graduated from yale in 1977." 9 when we asked him about the surgeon general's 10 report, he said, "i do not rely on the surgeon 11 general report. that is not authoritative." 12 but, ladies and gentlemen, you know what is 13 ironic about it? he testified, "that is a political 14 question. that is not a scientific medical 15 question. i do not rely on the surgeon general. 16 they do not know what they are talking about." 17 members of the jury, guess what? the surgeon 18 general in the united states of america graduated 19 from guess where? yale medical school, the school 20 he was so proud of graduating from. 21 "after years of well-funded research, it has 22 not been established that cigarette smoking 23 produces a physical dependence on nicotine." 24 this is a public document. they are denying 25 that it is addictive. meanwhile, inside company, they are trying to figure out how to make 2 it more addictive. remember, we just read a 3 document, is not it great that people do not know. 4 we are happy they are unsatisfied because they are 5 going to buy more cigarettes. 6 the claim that there is a physical dependence 7 for smoking is simply a desperate attempt to find 8 some way to differentiate smoking from other 9 habits. this is a public document. habit. the 10 internal confidential documents will mainly say 11 addiction. 12 the surgeon general has repeatedly stated that 13 his goal is a smokeless society, that he believes 14 smoking is one of the most addictive drugs in 15 society, and he has voiced his support of persons 16 suing tobacco companies. consequently, it is not 17 reasonable to expect that a report coming from his 18 office would be objective in its view on the 19 subject of cigarette smoking behavior. this is an 20 internal document. they are taking on the surgeon 21 general of the united states of america and 22 basically calling him a politically motivated liar. 23 we have the responsibility of guiding a 24 research program through which a tobacco industry 25 research committee already has provided $2.2 million in 1957, $2.2 million, for grants to 2 independent scientists working in the field of 3 cancer and other challenges of human survival. 4 the research, thus far, has produced no 5 evidence that cigarette smoking or other tobacco 6 use contributes to the origin of lung cancer. many 7 experiments on inhalation of cigarette smoke in 8 animals have failed to produce a single cancer 9 similar to the most prevalent type of lung cancer 10 in humans. 11 ladies and gentlemen, this is phase ii of the 12 conspiracy. they went to universities. they 13 commissioned committees. $2.2 million in 1957. 14 they were paying. they gave $2.2 million in 15 grants. they said "independent scientists." we are 16 going to get to slides later; but, ladies and 17 gentlemen, you will see another theme amongst these 18 tobacco companies, when these committees that they 19 commissioned for research, some of them are 20 universities, some of them are independent, when 21 they produce or find, make factual findings, that 22 tobacco is addictive or is harmful, they terminate 23 the grant. 24 here's a confidential letter. there are 25 biologically active materials present in cigarette tobacco. these are cancer-causing, 2 cancer-promoting, poisonous, stimulating, 3 pleasurable and flavorful. 4 members of the jury, 1957, they just said 5 there is no evidence that cigarette smoking or 6 other tobacco use contributes to the origin of lung 7 cancer. and here we go, mr. little here 8 confidentially saying it can cause cancer, promote 9 cancer -- 10 mr. persons: objection to that. 11 mr. chestnut: we are moving on, your honor. 12 the tobacco institute, one of these 13 committees, claims that cigarettes -- "the claims 14 that cigarettes are addictive is irresponsible and 15 are scare tactics." 16 again, this is a public document. and so 17 they are saying to the public, this tobacco 18 institute is telling the public, hey, the fact that 19 these claims that cigarettes are addictive are 20 scare tactics. let us look at what they are saying 21 amongst themselves. 22 sorry. this is another public document. here 23 we go. it is part of their strategy, ladies and 24 gentlemen. advocate the public's right to smoke 25 without actually urging them to take up practice, but create doubt about the health charge 2 without actually denying it. this is their 3 strategy. this is their conspiracy. this is their 4 document. 5 here's another example of the committee. 6 ladies and gentlemen, "the executive committee has 7 letters of agreement to get journalism school 8 studies of communication materials underway and 9 have been negotiated with michigan state 10 university, university of georgia and university of 11 texas. the letters of agreement include 12 confidentiality safeguards as discussed at our 13 meeting." 14 they have a confidentiality clause. so 15 they are giving money to the schools. they are 16 commissioning these communication materials about 17 smoking, telling the public they are safe, but 18 there is a confidentiality clause; meaning, if one 19 of these, michigan state university, university of 20 georgia, university of texas, discovers that 21 tobacco is harmful or addictive, there is a 22 confidentiality clause preventing them from, what, 23 telling the public the truth. lie, deny, blame the 24 smoker. 25 here's a document. this is ctr. it is tobacco industry research that says, "someone could attempt 2 to make a point regarding ctr that when research by 3 its grantees appear to be" -- 4 ms. schneider: your honor, may we approach? 5 take that down, please. 6 the court: sure. 7 mr. chestnut: i'll move on. 8 the court: mr. chestnut will take it down and 9 will not discuss it. we will move to the next document. 10 not a problem. 11 mr. chestnut: let us go to the next one. 12 thank you. 13 here's the tobacco institute. "our basic 14 position in the cigarette controversy is subject to 15 the charge, and may be subject to a finding, that 16 we are making false or misleading statements to 17 promote the sale of cigarettes." 18 this is a confidential document so they are 19 admitting that there is a controversy. they are 20 worried that the truth may come out. they are 21 making false or misleading statements to promote 22 the sale of cigarettes, ladies and gentlemen. 23 they are putting profit over the safety of the 24 american public. 25 this is a tobacco document, ladies and gentlemen, the tobacco institute incorporated. 2 that is the conspiracy of all the companies, that is 3 part of what we have to prove. 4 an admission by the industry that excessive 5 cigarette smoking is bad for you is tantamount to 6 an admission of guilt with regard to the lung 7 cancer problem. this could open the door to legal 8 suits in which the industry would have no defense. 9 so we have been through lie about the harmful 10 effects, through their documents, we have established 11 deny the addictive nature. this is the beginning 12 of the theme, blame the smoker, ladies and 13 gentlemen. 14 if we admit that excessive smoking is bad for 15 you, it is tantamount to an admission of guilt. to 16 suggest that coping techniques are not of his own 17 choosing and are predetermined certainly does not 18 constitute good faith on the part of the industry 19 toward its consumers. 20 ladies and gentlemen, that is a convoluted way 21 of saying these cigarettes are addictive. they are 22 addictive, choice, from their document way back. 23 so, ladies and gentlemen, all these arguments 24 we have been hearing for the last three weeks about 25 it was mr. cavalier's choice, it was mr. cavalier's choice, it was never his choice. it was never 2 america's choice. you know whose choice it was? 3 tobacco. 4 you know what they chose? money over the 5 safety of the american public. they chose to lie 6 to the american public. they chose to deny the 7 truth to the american public. they chose to blame 8 the public for becoming susceptible to the very 9 marketing they are spending millions of dollars 10 trying to convince the public. and then they throw 11 it back on the public for smoking their product. 12 again, ladies and gentlemen, they admit, their 13 own document, 20 years, this was their strategy. 14 three major fronts: litigation, politics, public 15 opinion. public opinion. it is a smoker's choice. 16 they choose to smoke. smoking is not addictive. 17 it is not a chemical. nicotine does not affect your 18 brain. there is no freebase. it is a choice. it is 19 willpower. you cannot stop smoking, you are weak. 20 that is not what they think, but that is what they 21 tell the public. 22 let us talk about addiction. addiction is a 23 chronic relapsing brain disease. did they know? 24 so the irony in this, it is 2015. one of the major 25 issues in this litigation -- ms. schneider: your honor, may we approach? 2 take it down, please. 3 the clerk: you have 20 minutes. 4 mr. chestnut: 20 minutes still. 5 your honor, i'll just move on. that is fine. 6 the court: he is going to move on. we are 7 good. 8 mr. chestnut: one of the major issues we have 9 been arguing about is addiction. ladies and 10 gentlemen, we are going to see a number of documents 11 that say, what, the tobacco companies, plural, not 12 only conspired to addiction, but they knew the 13 cigarettes were addictive way back. 14 cigarette smoking is more addictive than using 15 heroin, hooking two-thirds of the people, whoever 16 smoked. but we just spent the whole morning 17 listening to a hired expert telling all of us that 18 mr. cavalier is not addicted, that it is his choice, 19 that he was weak because he chose to smoke. 20 but their own people say, hooking two-thirds 21 of people, whoever smoke, we cannot defend continued 22 smoking as free choice if the person was addicted. 23 this is their document. this is their theory in 24 this case. 25 mr. persons: objection, your honor. attacks the defense of the case. motion. 2 the court: it is from the document. 3 overruled. 4 mr. chestnut: it is fortunate for us that 5 cigarettes are a habit the public cannot break. 6 although more people talk about taste, it is 7 likely a greater number smoke for the narcotic 8 value that comes from the nicotine, addiction. 9 ladies and gentlemen, a cigarette -- in 1969, 10 a cigarette will even preempt food in times of 11 scarcity on the smokers priority list. 12 ladies and gentlemen, this is important, 13 because in 1969, they are saying that a cigarette 14 will preempt food in times of scarcity on the 15 smokers priority list. 16 well, let us -- let us think about 17 mr. cavalier's priority list. think about the 18 testimony we heard from the cavalier family. 19 mr. persons: objection to that one. 20 the court: sure. 21 mr. chestnut: i'll move on. 22 the court: he will move on. he will move on. 23 mr. persons: i need a ruling on it. 24 the court: yes. 25 mr. persons: and there is -- ms. schneider: objection to this one, too. 2 mr. persons: and there is a number of them 3 like that, and they are not even on the plaintiffs' 4 exhibit list, so when we move, they take it down. 5 the court: he is okay. 6 mr. chestnut: i'll tell you what -- 7 the court: he will move on. that is fine. he is 8 okay. we are good. we are good. we will move on. 9 mr. chestnut: we have seen enough tobacco 10 documents today. 11 so what is it really, ladies and gentlemen, 12 that this case is about? a lot of this has to do 13 with credibility. 14 and so i just want to plant some things in 15 your mind so you can think about it as you hear our 16 closing arguments. 17 now, first and foremost, we have the burden of 18 proof, we do, the greater weight of the evidence. 19 we are the plaintiffs. 20 members of the jury, we presented you with 21 over two weeks of evidence. they did one day. 22 mr. persons: objection. 23 the court: overruled. 24 mr. chestnut: members of the jury, you will 25 hear in the defense closing a lot of different theories about causation, because there is some 2 things that you are going to have to determine. 3 here's what i submit to you that this comes -- this 4 case comes down to this regarding mr. cavalier. 5 "a" versus "the." two words, ladies and gentlemen, 6 that is what the case is about, "a" versus "the." 7 let us take a look at -- now yesterday we heard 8 from dr. w let us call him. and the doctor's 9 primary contention was that copd was the cause of 10 smoking. and he and i got into this big kind of 11 spar over "a" versus "the." and ultimately he had 12 to conclude that cigarette smoking is "a" cause of 13 cardiovascular disease and that cardiovascular 14 disease is "a" cause of death from smoking. 15 so let us look at the difference between "a," 16 ladies and gentlemen, and "the." 17 the word "a" or letter, is an indefinite 18 article. so it is not particular or certain of one 19 class or a group. it is "a." 20 so if mr. cavalier has copd, cardiovascular 21 disease, diabetes, and lung cancer, all we have to 22 prove is that cardiovascular disease is "a," 23 indefinite, one of, one of the causes of his death. 24 what the defense will submit to you is that it 25 is "the" cause. they are going to submit to you -- they are going to argue to you, ladies and 2 gentlemen, that cardiovascular disease is "the" 3 cause of death, which is why they have made such a 4 huge deal out of the death certificate when they 5 say that copd is "the" only cause of death. we will 6 get to the death certificate. 7 "the" is distinct from "a." "the" is a 8 definite article used especially before a noun, 9 with a specifying or particularized effect, as 10 opposed to the indefinite or generalized force of 11 the indefinite article "a." so "a" is the opposite 12 of "the." 13 why is that important for us, ladies and 14 gentlemen, "a" versus "the"? 15 we, as the plaintiffs, the court will instruct 16 you, here's the first question you will have to 17 answer on your verdict form. 18 was smoking cigarettes "a" not "the," a legal 19 cause of mr. cavalier's coronary artery disease? 20 and, if so, was coronary artery disease "a" legal 21 cause of his death, not "the" legal cause of his 22 death. it has to be "a" legal cause of his death. 23 so whether copd was a contributing factor, 24 whether diabetes was a contributing factor, whether 25 the lung cancer was a contributing factor, he had cardiovascular disease. it is one of the causes 2 legally of his death. 3 mr. persons: objection. misstates the law, 4 your honor. 5 the court: overruled. 6 mr. chestnut: that is our verdict. i submit 7 to you we will make it. and it is in the jury 8 instruction as well. and i do not want to go 9 through it. but i'll just highlight it very 10 quickly, ladies and gentlemen, that even in the 11 jury instructions -- and i want to go through this 12 with you because it is important. 13 because it says, "in order to be regarded as a 14 legal cause of coronary artery disease, cigarette 15 smoking need not be the only cause." this is the 16 jury instruction. instruction 5, in order to be 17 regarded as a legal cause cigarette smoking does 18 not have to be the only cause. smoking cigarettes 19 may be a legal cause of coronary artery disease 20 even though it operates in, what, combination with 21 some other cause if smoking cigarettes contributes 22 substantially to producing coronary artery disease. 23 let me go a little further. coronary artery 24 disease is a legal cause of mr. cavalier's death if 25 it directly and in a natural and continuous sequence produced or contributed substantially to 2 producing such death so that it can be said but for 3 the coronary artery disease, the death would not 4 have occurred. 5 now, this is very important because this will 6 make you think, wait now, wait now, it says but for 7 the coronary artery disease, the death would not 8 have occurred. in other words, plaintiffs must 9 prove that but for the coronary artery disease, he 10 would not have died. that is an important 11 paragraph. 12 you are going to hear a lot of argument on 13 that. but i just submit to you, let us read the 14 next paragraph that qualifies this one. the next 15 paragraph says, "in order to be regarded as a legal 16 cause of death, coronary artery disease need not be 17 the only cause. coronary artery disease may be a 18 legal cause of death, even though it operates in 19 combination with some other cause if coronary 20 artery disease contributes substantially to the 21 death." 22 that is the jury instruction, ladies and 23 gentlemen. it is just got to be one of them. it 24 does not have to be the only one. 25 that is what the argument has been about death certificate. before we get to the death 2 certificate, can we go to 508157? 3 so was mr. cavalier diagnosed with coronary 4 artery disease? william ludwig, december 7th, 5 1990, writing to dr. cowen. thank you very much 6 for the privilege of seeing mr. cavalier again -- 7 then exchange of pleasantries. can we go down to 8 the bottom? 9 clinical impressions: evidence of 10 atherosclerotic heart disease and underlying 11 myocardial dysfunction. he is got heart dysfunction 12 and evidence of atherosclerotic heart disease. 13 now, you remember yesterday, i'll get to it a 14 little later, but dr. w came in, and he was arguing 15 down that heart disease -- or that copd was the 16 only cause of death. 17 but, ladies and gentlemen, dyspnea is a 18 shortness of breath. it says it is probably 19 multifactorial, which means there are many causes, 20 copd, heart disease, and myocardial dysfunction. 21 now, according to the jury instruction we just 22 read and the verdict form that you will receive, 23 that is sufficient for us to prevail and go to phase 24 ii. 25 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. that is a gross misstatement of the law -- 2 the court: sustained. 3 mr. persons: and move -- 4 mr. hohnbaum: -- and move to strike it. 5 the court: denied. 6 mr. chestnut: we submit to you that this is 7 evidence to prove that mr. cavalier had heart 8 disease diagnosed in 1990. the doctor admitted 9 yesterday that there is no other medical record 10 demonstrating that mr. cavalier had or was 11 diagnosed with heart disease prior to 1990. that is 12 important, because there is a statute of 13 limitations. so he has to be diagnosed with this 14 after 1990. this is 12/7/1990, first document, 15 first doctor to diagnose it. 16 and moreover -- can we go back up top? 17 because there is going to be argument about, well, 18 we do not have all the medical records, a lot of the 19 medical records are missing. 20 but you know, this doctor says a lot for us. 21 because he says that this is a consultation 22 follow-up, which means dr. cowen referred mr. 23 cavalier to dr. ludwig for a consultation, which 24 means he is sending him to the -- to this doctor for 25 an evaluation of what is wrong with his heart. this is further evidence that this is the 2 diagnosis, that there is no prior treatment for the 3 heart, no prior diagnosis of heart conditions. 4 the clerk: counsel, you have 10 minutes. 5 mr. chestnut: thank you, ma'am. 6 let us go to the -- so the next question is: 7 was mr. -- can we go to cavalier 33? 8 was mr. cavalier addicted? now, we just heard 9 testimony about that, right? how about let us start 10 out -- now, dr. -- dr. feingold came in. we 11 brought him in. he testified to you that there are 12 basically two ways of determining addiction. 13 but before we get into the complex cases on 14 addiction, let us just go to common sense, ladies 15 and gentlemen. 16 ladies and gentlemen, you have heard 17 testimony -- you have seen documentation that 18 mr. cavalier smoked four to six packs a day. so 19 that is over a 100 cigarettes a day for 50 years. a 20 100 packs a day, 50 years, and that he tried 21 multiple times to quit, and he was never able to 22 quit. 23 and his daughter testified that the last 24 couple days of his life he was on oxygen, and 25 that is why he stopped smoking. so common sense says he was addicted. can we go to dr. feingold? 2 you ready? 3 so here's what is important about what you have 4 heard. you have heard from dr. feingold. 5 dr. feingold diagnosed mr. cavalier with the -- 6 with being addicted to cigarettes based off of the 7 fagerstrom. and he differentiated why he used this 8 test and not the dsm-5 test which was used today. 9 why is it? 10 well, ladies and gentlemen, here's the dsm-5 11 test. guess what? you kind of need the person 12 alive to answer these questions. "have you had 13 unsuccessful efforts to quit?" they did not even 14 ask mr. cavalier that. "cravings for tobacco." 15 you need to ask mr. cavalier that. "failure to 16 attend to responsibilities or obligations due to 17 tobacco." you have got to ask mr. cavalier that. 18 but he is been dead since 1993. it is 2015. 19 members of the jury, the fagerstrom, which is 20 dr. feingold used, does not require that. these are 21 objective questions. "how soon after you wake do 22 you crave smoking?" well, his daughter can observe 23 that. "was it difficult for him to stop?" these 24 are observations. well, let us just disregard all 25 of that. the basics is this: over a 100 cigarettes a 2 day. there is a deposition read in for 3 mr. possidento yesterday that said he would buy two 4 cartons at a time and bring them to work with him 5 every night. two cartons. not the packets. two 6 cartons. 7 and there is an argument that he is not 8 addicted? that is an argument that he is not 9 addicted from the same folks who have internal 10 documents saying that -- 11 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 12 the court: sustained. 13 ms. schneider: me, too. 14 the court: that is okay. 15 mr. persons: and motion. 16 the court: denied. 17 mr. chestnut: so next, ladies and gentlemen, 18 let us talk about dr. w. 19 you know, it is kind of unfortunate -- can we 20 go to the second slide? 21 so this is -- 22 ms. schneider: objection, your honor. 23 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 24 ms. schneider: it is not in evidence. 25 mr. chestnut: it is the -- hohnbaum: we specifically excluded it. 2 mr. chestnut: it is the surgeon general 3 report. 4 the court: he is just using it as a 5 demonstrative. it is not in evidence. 6 mr. chestnut: so this is the surgeon general. 7 he went to yale medical school. so did dr. w. 8 let us talk about what the surgeon general -- 9 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 10 mr. chestnut: it is demonstrative. 11 the court: tie it to proctor's testimony. 12 ms. schneider: what? 13 mr. hohnbaum: may we approach on that, your 14 honor? 15 the court: sure. 16 mr. chestnut: your honor, i tell you what, 17 we will move on. 18 mr. hohnbaum: may we approach, your honor? 19 the court: okay. no, because he moved on, 20 mr. hohnbaum. 21 mr. hohnbaum: i'll make a motion on that, 22 your honor. 23 the court: denied. 24 mr. hohnbaum: thank you. 25 mr. chestnut: can we pull this up on addiction? 2 dr. w said he relied upon the death 3 certificate in forming his conclusions. that is 4 what he told you yesterday. 5 now, he also said that he taught students, he 6 teaches doctors, and that it is very important 7 that -- and he stresses this to his students, that 8 you be accurate in your diagnosis, that you verify 9 the accuracy of documents, that you read the 10 details, the devil's in the details. this is 11 medicine. people's lives are at stake. they have 12 a hippocratic oath to do no harm to a patient. 13 ladies and gentlemen, we locked him in. he 14 said, yeah, you have got to be accurate. yeah, i 15 teach my students on it. you have got to read the 16 document. 17 the court: mr. chestnut, five minutes. 18 mr. chestnut: five minutes. okay. 19 i thought i had a pointer here. 20 ladies and gentlemen, now we all know -- he 21 said he reviewed, he did his homework. but he also 22 said -- actually, he did say he did his homework, 23 he said they did his powerpoint. but he said he 24 reviewed the documents. 25 we all know mr. cavalier could not read because he only went to the third grade. the death 2 certificate says "12th grade." 3 now, we are not knocking dr. cowen, i'm not 4 challenging dr. cowen. i'm just looking at the 5 document. and it is like an exercise of microsoft 6 word because there is too many fonts on this 7 document. you have got manuscripts, sans script, 8 times new roman. i mean, so let us just look at 9 this. so here's one signature. here's where 10 dr. cowen signs, right? 11 now, let us go back -- wait, wait, wait. 12 now, dr. cohen -- dr. cowen -- look at this, 13 right? look at that font. that is cursive. then 14 he goes to print, allegedly, misspells his name. 15 now, he is done (sic) had that since he was a kid, 16 and this is a trained doctor. so now it is 17 c-o-h-e-n, even though up here it is c-o-w-e-n. but 18 it is cursive here. it is printed there. 19 can we go down to the diagnosis? and then 20 it is real loopy here like big p's. look at that 21 circle on "o." that is totally different. that is a 22 totally different font than before. 23 are we knocking dr. cowen? no. are we saying 24 he probably did not sign this death certificate? 25 yes. he is a busy doctor. how do we know? here's a 2008 document. here's his signature. 2 totally different from the signature here. and, 3 look, even on this document they spell his name 4 right. c-o-w-n (sic), not c-o-h-e-n. more 5 important, here he diagnoses it as lung cancer. 6 here's what we are saying, ladies and 7 gentlemen, dr. w comes in and testified to a 8 reasonable degree of medical certainty that the 9 only cause of death is copd. and i say how did you 10 get there? well, i'm relying on the death 11 certificate. 12 well, we can agree there are inaccuracies on 13 the death certificate. we say, "well, i'm relying 14 on dr. cowen." dr. cowen is relying on dr. cowen. 15 in 1993, he says "copd." in 2008, he says 16 "lung cancer." we are not saying either one of them 17 are wrong. what are we saying? both of them will 18 what, "a" cause, not "the," "a" cause. 19 cardiovascular disease is a cause. 20 now, there are lines here that could have been 21 filled out. they could have put lung cancer here. 22 they could have put cardiovascular disease here. 23 they did not. the document is inaccurate. so you 24 cannot rely just on this death certificate as a 25 cause of death. but you know what we can rely on is the 2 medical records. so dr. w kept saying well, the 3 medical records said he was getting better, he was 4 getting better, he was getting better. i said, 5 okay, no problem. show us one medical record 6 saying that. show us one medical record the last 7 two weeks he was in -- that mr. cavalier was in the 8 hospital showing that he got better. he did not 9 show us one. 10 you know why, ladies and gentlemen? because 11 there is not one. he did not show us one medical 12 record for the last two weeks that said -- of mr. 13 cavalier's life, that mentioned copd. you know 14 why? because there was not one, and there is not 15 one. 16 more importantly, ladies and gentlemen, can i 17 have 50826 -- 272? 18 so then dr. w says well, you know, he was 19 getting better. he was feeling better. all right. 20 but here we have an ejection fraction of 29 21 percent. i will not go into the diagrams on it. but 22 if we recall, ejection fraction is -- is how much 23 capacity the heart has to pump. and the normal -- 24 dr. feingold told us and he showed us a graph. a 25 normal ejection fraction is 55 percent. nine days before mr. cavalier dies, he is at 29 percent. 2 dr. w told you, man, yeah, 29 percent, you are good. 3 anything less than thirty percent is an industry 4 standard severe. 5 he says well, the patient was doing so good, 6 he could go back to regular life. 7 i said, okay, doctor, no problem. show us one 8 record where he was discharged from the funeral 9 home? i'm sorry. where he was discharged from the 10 hospital, where he was sent home since he was 11 getting better. he was not sent home. he was sent 12 to dorsey funeral home nine days later. he never 13 got better, ladies and gentlemen. 14 the court: one minute, mr. chestnut. 15 mr. chestnut: thank you. 16 and there is no document or diagnosis in the 17 last nine days of mr. cavalier's life demonstrating 18 anything other than heart complications. 19 now, the judge has told you about credibility 20 of witnesses, correct? and the medical records are 21 in evidence. you can take them back with you. 22 here's what i want to submit to you, ladies 23 and gentlemen, there is no mention -- so they go 24 through this elaborate presentation on symptoms of 25 congestive heart failure. what is not on there, ladies and gentlemen? 2 ejection fraction. these the most important, most 3 repeated symptom of congestive heart failure. they 4 did not leave it on there. because you know why? 5 because that is what happened. because it 6 demonstrates that there was -- that congestive 7 heart failure was a cause of death. 8 now i have to take my seat. but let me just 9 share one other thing with you. 10 mr. gary: he can use some of my time, your 11 honor. 12 mr. chestnut: i want to go over the factors 13 with you, because dr. w started talking about 14 factors of smoking, right? so here he said these 15 are the factors of smoking: diabetes, family 16 history, smoking. 17 and then there was an objection to the surgeon 18 general's report; is that correct? 19 ms. schneider: yes. 20 mr. chestnut: okay, cool. 21 so i would submit to you that there is 22 evidence out there, that there is medical evidence, 23 medical publishings, medical treatises that -- 24 ms. schneider: objection, your honor. 25 mr. persons: objection. chestnut: i did not say -- 2 the court: keep going. 3 mr. chestnut: i did not say -- that relate 4 smoking to causing -- 5 ms. schneider: objection. 6 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. this is 7 exactly what we addressed yesterday. 8 the court: no -- no -- no -- no speaking 9 objections. 10 mr. chestnut: your honor, i have not cited a 11 specific source. 12 the court: no, go ahead. mr. chestnut, let 13 me hear -- let me hear the statement first. let me 14 hear the statement first. you may continue, 15 mr. chestnut. 16 mr. chestnut: that there is documentation out 17 there, there are medical findings that infer that 18 diabetes can be caused by smoking. 19 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor, and move 20 to strike. 21 the court: sustained. 22 mr. chestnut: let us do this. they went 23 through all these causes, right? if you recall 24 they kind of glossed over smoking. they did the 25 powerpoint, but they -- hohnbaum: motion, your honor, on that. 2 i'm sorry. 3 the court: okay. denied. 4 mr. hohnbaum: thank you. 5 mr. chestnut: they did the powerpoint, but 6 they kind of glossed over this point of smoking. 7 and here's what is interesting. members of the 8 jury, they said these are mr. cavalier's risk 9 factors for coronary artery disease, right? risk 10 factors. i do not have it on here, so i'm going to 11 show it to you on the elmo. and to support that, 12 they showed you a medical record. 13 now, mr. cavalier, we just saw, was diagnosed 14 with cardiovascular disease in december of 1990. 15 members of the jury, they showed you a document 16 saying -- the doctor says, "i have begged him to 17 begin exercising," from 1992. 18 so, members of the jury, they want you to 19 believe that no. 7 on their list of physical 20 inactivity is a risk factor for mr. cavalier's 21 coronary artery disease. here's the problem. the 22 risk factor came two years after the diagnosis. 23 how can there be a risk of something you already 24 have, ladies and gentlemen? credibility of 25 evidence. members of the jury, we have submitted a 2 significant amount of evidence to you. we can 3 prove or we have proved, to a reasonable -- to -- 4 to -- by a greater weight of the evidence, our 5 case. now, mr. acosta is going to come up and 6 share some additional facts, research with you, mr. 7 gary is going to come after that and share with you 8 documents. we just ask your continued patience. 9 but we also ask for accountability. ladies 10 and gentlemen, hold both sides accountable. 11 question the evidence. there were a lot of 12 opinions up here, but they were based off 13 powerpoints, a lot of records. our experts, they 14 had records, and their records corroborated the 15 powerpoints that we showed you. they taught you. 16 they took you through how they came to their 17 conclusions. dr. w could not explain how he got to 18 his conclusions because the doctor he relied on had 19 multiple findings. credibility of the evidence is 20 important, ladies and gentlemen, credibility of the 21 source. 22 thank you for your attention. 25 mr. acosta: good afternoon. i hope you had a nice lunch. i'm going to continue sort of where 2 mr. chestnut left off, with the lying and the 3 denying and the blaming. 4 you know, mr. cavalier was a pretty typical 5 smoker except that he smoked a lot more than most 6 smokers smoke, five to six packs a day. but you 7 now what? he was doing just what the cigarette 8 companies wanted him to do. 9 but the cigarette company wants you to think 10 that mr. cavalier knew more than they did, that he 11 should have known that they were not telling him the 12 truth, that he should have just put down the 13 cigarettes. but reynolds is the one that got him 14 to do that, and he smoked their cigarettes exactly 15 the way reynolds wanted him to smoke them. he 16 bought a lot of cigarettes over the years and got 17 caught in a big web. that web is a true-to-life 18 conspiracy of the tobacco companies that all made 19 an agreement to deny. 20 and the reason they did that is because if one 21 of them admitted it, one of them admitted it, the 22 cat would be out of the bag. if that happened, the 23 others would fall. the whole industry would have 24 fallen. 25 so they lied. so they lied. there really is no justification for that when it comes to human 2 life. this is not about making a little more money 3 selling wallpaper. this is about killing people. 4 mr. persons: objection, your honor; 5 inflammatory. 6 the court: overruled. 7 mr. acosta: so i'm going to show you some 8 slides and talk a little bit, and then i'll sit 9 down and then mr. gary will go and he will wrap it 10 up. 11 first thing we have got to do is we have got to 12 prove that thomas cavalier was a member of the 13 engle class. this is the definition of "class 14 members." class members are florida smokers or 15 residents, which he was, who suffered or died, he 16 died, from a cigarette-related illness, which is 17 coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, 18 caused by an addiction to cigarettes containing 19 nicotine. 20 that is our burden. if we have proved that to 21 you to your satisfaction -- you are the ones that 22 decide that. we think we have put enough evidence on 23 to prove it to you -- then you will be answering 24 questions: was thomas cavalier addicted to rjr 25 cigarettes containing nicotine? ms. schneider: your honor, that is a 2 misstatement of the -- 3 mr. acosta: well, i'm just paraphrasing. 4 the court: he is -- 5 ms. schneider: atherosclerotic heart disease 6 is not the disease -- 7 the court: okay. that is fine. okay. i'll 8 sustain. that is fine. 9 mr. acosta: well, okay. i just put 10 atherosclerotic heart disease. it is coronary 11 artery disease. it is chf. there is a number of 12 different ways you can describe it, but it is heart 13 disease. and then whether that was a legal cause 14 of his death. 15 a legal cause need not be the only cause. 16 that is in the instruction, and it is important 17 because there is two instructions on causation. and 18 the second one talks about concurring cause. a 19 legal cause is a substantial contributing cause. 20 we call that instruction the concurring cause 21 instruction, but all it means is that a legal cause 22 is a substantial contributing cause. 23 and if you think about it, there are lots of 24 situations where things combine and can cause an 25 injury or cause a death, any one of which might not be enough to cause the injury or death, but when 2 they act together, they cause the injury or death. 3 that is why we have this instruction, because it 4 permits us to show causation and prove causation 5 without having to prove but for the -- 6 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. that is 7 a misstatement. 8 the court: sustained. 9 mr. acosta: this is the one that you can 10 follow. a legal cause can be one of many causes. 11 greater weight of the evidence shows thomas 12 cavalier died from his addiction to several 13 cigarette-related illnesses. he had three 14 cigarette-related illnesses. he had lung cancer, 15 he had copd, and he had congestive heart failure 16 that backed up fluid into his lungs. 17 "greater weight" means the more persuasive and 18 convincing force and effect of the entire evidence. 19 so when you go back into the jury room, you will have 20 to decide, well, which side, the plaintiff -- which 21 is us -- or the defendants, had the more persuasive 22 convincing force and effect of the entire evidence, 23 the entire evidence that you have heard in the case. 24 for class members -- it is kind of cut off at 25 the top. for class members, the findings are going to be the law, and this is the first -- the first 2 one i put up here is that nicotine in cigarettes is 3 addictive. there is no question about that. it is 4 been -- it is admitted and it is part of the 5 findings. 6 reynolds placed cigarettes on the market that 7 were defective and unreasonably dangerous. now, if 8 you think about it, there was a warning back in 9 1970 that said cigarettes are dangerous to your 10 health. they did not say they were unreasonably 11 dangerous. 12 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 13 preemption and we have got a stipulation. 14 the court: sustained -- reference the 15 preemption then. sustained. 16 mr. acosta: so unreasonably dangerous is 17 something that you cannot allow to happen because 18 it is unreasonable. it is not just dangerous; it is 19 unreasonable. 20 and it dealt with, you know, an engle trial 21 similar to this, but a lot bigger, it took a long 22 time, and in that case, much of the same 23 evidence -- 24 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 25 the court: sustained. acosta: cigarette -- smoking cigarettes 2 causes lung cancer, and then i'm going to go 3 through these findings again just so you will -- you 4 might see something that you had not seen before. 5 lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma, 6 large cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and 7 squamous cell. those are different kinds of lung 8 cancer; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 9 copd; and coronary heart disease. 10 reynolds concealed or omitted material 11 information. this is one of the findings, and 12 it will be binding on us -- it is binding on 13 everyone -- if he is a class member. reynolds 14 concealed or omitted material information not 15 otherwise known or available, knowing that the 16 material was false or misleading. 17 so that says they knew that the material that 18 they were concealing or not telling them about, 19 hiding, was important and it was false or 20 misleading or they failed to disclose a material 21 fact concerning the health effects or addictive 22 nature of smoking cigarettes or both. 23 and you have to remember, they denied that it 24 was addictive. if you remember that life magazine, 25 which had the coffin nails on it, in that magazine it said cigarettes are not addictive or even 2 habit-forming. that is what it said in that 3 magazine. 4 people -- there was a controversy created, and 5 it was created by the tobacco industry to keep 6 people smoking back then. it was a different time. 7 you know, we sort of get locked into the way things 8 are today and what we know today and it is hard to 9 think back as to the way things were. 10 and some of you are not as old as i am and -- 11 most of you, all of you, are not as old as me -- 12 and things were different. and we tried to show 13 you some of that with some of the advertisements 14 that were on early television. 15 you know, we showed you the flintstones, 16 barney and fred hiding behind a rock so that wilma 17 and betty will not see them smoking winstons. i mean, 18 that is how mundane cigarette smoking -- everybody 19 smoked then. everybody smoked. 20 then reynolds entered into an agreement to 21 conceal or omit information regarding the health 22 effects of cigarettes or the addictive nature with 23 the intention that smokers and the public would 24 rely on that information. 25 so how -- what is it that we do with corporations in this country, with companies that 2 make products? we rely on them to tell us the 3 truth about the product. it is common sense. you 4 rely on a company to tell you the truth about its 5 products, not to lie to you. and when you rely on 6 them, you buy their product. that is what 7 mr. cavalier did. reliance is buying cigarettes 8 because that is exactly what they wanted him to do. 9 mr. persons: objection, your honor. that is a 10 misstatement. 11 the court: sustained. 12 mr. persons: motion. 13 the court: denied. 14 mr. acosta: reynolds was negligent. in that 15 set of instructions, it defines "negligence." it is 16 unreasonable conduct. you have a duty to do things 17 right. they were wrong. it was unreasonable 18 conduct. 19 so let us talk about thomas cavalier's 20 addiction to nicotine for a minute that caused him 21 to die -- that caused him to die from those three 22 diseases. i already mentioned that. what they 23 did, those three diseases destroyed his ability to 24 breathe. 25 when he had lung cancer in 1989, they removed the upper lobe of one of his lungs. it is a big 2 hunk of lung. so what does that do? that gives 3 you less breathing capacity because you are missing 4 part of your lung. the injury from that cancer was 5 a reduction in his lung capacity. 6 copd. you heard about emphysema and the 7 cavities it causes in the lungs, so copd reduces 8 your breathing capacity so that it makes it very 9 difficult for you to breathe. you can breathe in, 10 but you cannot get the air out. if you cannot get 11 the air out, you cannot get more air in. 12 the heart disease put fluid in his lungs, 13 because his heart was weakened by his coronary 14 artery disease. and when you weaken the heart, it 15 cannot pump blood back in through your lungs. you 16 have to get oxygen by having your heart pump blood 17 through your lungs. it gives it oxygen, then it 18 goes back to the heart and goes out the other side. 19 but when you put fluid in the lungs and you are 20 already missing some lung and you are already 21 stricken with emphysema, the coronary artery 22 disease was the straw that broke the camel's back, 23 and that is exactly what happened to mr. cavalier. 24 he had this situation happen in the hospital and he 25 died. why so much talk about the death certificate? 2 well, there was a may 5, 1990, cutoff for copd and 3 lung cancer. back when the death certificate was 4 signed and filled out, nobody thought about what 5 the impact of that would be. you know, it was just 6 a routine event for the doctor in the doctor's 7 office. 8 you know, somebody from the funeral home comes 9 and gives him the death certificate and who signs 10 it? was it somebody on the staff? did dr. cowen 11 just say something like, you know, "go look at the 12 intake form and see what he was admitted for and 13 put it on there"? we do not know, but we know it is 14 wrong. i put dr. cowen up there because it is a 15 different writing. 16 i do not want to dwell on it, but this death 17 certificate, it is not really wrong; it just is not 18 correct. it is not filled out completely. it 19 does not have the other two diseases that combined 20 to cause his death. 21 all right. dr. cowen testified by deposition, 22 and he testified thomas cavalier had evidence of 23 congestive heart failure which contributed to his 24 shortness of breath. he said so. 25 dr. cowen said that congestive heart failure causes fluid to fill the lungs. he got fluid from 2 his body into his lungs and it is not supposed to be 3 there, and then he got an infection. 4 dr. cowen again says mr. cavalier's heart 5 failure prevented his heart from getting enough 6 oxygen. part of his heart muscle died. this is 7 key testimony from dr. cowen. 8 dr. cowen said: and is there any way -- this 9 is the question: "is there any way to tell from 10 the medical records when there is a reference to 11 shortness of breath that the shortness of breath is 12 being caused by his congestive heart failure versus 13 his copd?" 14 what does he say? he says: "it is probably a 15 combination of the two." 16 so he is admitting that his heart failure 17 combined with the copd to cause his death. 18 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 19 misstatement of the evidence. 20 the court: overruled. 21 mr. acosta: dr. cowen -- "doctor, was his 22 cardiomyopathy ischemic cardiomyopathy or was it 23 diabetic cardiomyopathy?" 24 dr. cowen said it is ischemic, different from 25 the type that is caused by diabetes. we have dr. feingold. dr. feingold is a 2 pulmonologist down in south florida, miami, and you 3 can -- i mean, just think about how he testified 4 and what he said and the way he explained things. 5 very intelligent man. he knows how to explain 6 medicine. he knows the medicine very well. 7 and lung doctors and heart doctors, they have 8 to work together because the lungs are part of the 9 cardiovascular testimony so that you can get oxygen 10 to the rest of your body and your brain. 11 he is asked: "what was the primary cause of 12 thomas cavalier's death?" 13 he answers: "ischemic cardiomyopathy." 14 and that is kind of a fancy name for not enough 15 blood getting to the heart. that is what damaged 16 his heart. that is coronary artery disease. 17 ischemia, he explained that when you -- the heart 18 pumps oxygenated blood out, it goes back -- some of 19 it goes back to the heart and all the little 20 arteries in your heart that give the heart muscle 21 the oxygen it needs to pump. 22 so feingold says the same thing that dr. cowen 23 said, it was ischemic, which means it was not from 24 diabetes. 25 you have seen that a couple times now, this ejection fraction. this is like eight days, nine 2 days before he dies; and his heart is so weak that 3 it only pumps 29 percent of what it is supposed to 4 pump. and dr. feingold said anything below 30 5 means you are on the edge of death. 6 dr. feingold concludes: "cigarette smoking 7 was a major contributor to this man's congestive 8 heart failure and a major component of what caused 9 him to die. 10 so it is a substantial contributing cause. 11 that makes it a legal cause. that makes it a legal 12 cause. 13 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. that is 14 a misstatement of the law as well. 15 the court: sustained. 16 mr. acosta: dr. feingold signed this board. 17 "i certify to a reasonable degree of medical 18 certainty the following findings: 19 "was thomas cavalier addicted to nicotine? 20 "yes." 21 and i'm going to go through some of that in a 22 minute. 23 "was thomas cavalier's addiction to cigarettes 24 containing nicotine a medical cause of his death? 25 "yes. "did thomas cavalier die from heart disease 2 caused by smoking? 3 "yes." 4 that is the proof, that is the proof that makes 5 thomas cavalier a class member. i mean, think 6 about it. how could this guy not be a class 7 member? he is a poster child for a class member. 8 and feingold talked about the three diseases, 9 that he died from all three. 10 thomas cavalier was addicted to five packs a 11 day. it is a decision. it results in people 12 smoking more than they would otherwise. that is 13 what addiction does, it makes you smoke more than 14 you would otherwise would have smoked. 15 "addiction results in changes to the 16 decision-making part of the brain. 17 so it influences you. that is what an 18 addiction is. you know, it is not a voluntary 19 thing. it makes physical changes in your brain. 20 you can make a choice to try to stop; but the 21 problem is, hardly anybody stops. it is like 22 5 percent a year. 23 and when you add that up over 40 years, 24 5 percent of so many smokers, you do get 60 million 25 people that have stopped smoking; but those former smokers, if you think about it, if they were 2 regular smokers, one out of two of them died from 3 smoking. 4 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 5 the court: overruled. 6 mr. acosta: and that is even though they quit. 7 this is feingold from his testimony: "so, 8 yes, people who have a smoking rate of 100 9 cigarettes a day are addicted. there are no other 10 possible explanations to a reasonable degree of 11 certainty without evoking some weird thing maybe 12 that i did not think of. but as a regular issue, 13 people who smoke five packs or four packs or three 14 packs of cigarettes a day are very addicted to 15 nicotine, because they have a change in the brain 16 and that brain change is influencing their 17 behavior." 18 dr. feingold testifies: "nicotine addiction 19 was the cause of cigarette smoking and 20 mr. cavalier's death was ischemic cardiomyopathy, 21 copd, the loss of lung tissue from lung cancer, the 22 diabetes, all put together," all put together. 23 that is why we have the concurring cause 24 instruction, because all we have to show is that 25 his heart disease was a contributing cause of his death. 2 mr. persons: objection. misstates the law. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. acosta: dr. benowitz, you may remember 5 him. i'm going to show you a little film clip, and 6 i do not know how to start that with this thing. 7 (videotaped deposition of dr. benowitz played 8 as follows:) 9 q. why did not they take the nicotine out of the 10 cigarette? 11 a. "well, people do not smoke cigarettes without 12 nicotine. they smoke cigarettes as a way to get 13 nicotine. and so --" 14 "things that are driven by these brain reward 15 centers are ones that are more powerful than your 16 logical reasoning." 17 "without nicotine there, without addictive 18 smoking to get nicotine, there would not be 19 smoking-related cancer, heart disease, or lung disease." 20 some people can quit pretty easily and some 21 people have great difficulty quitting and some people 22 never, ever manage to quit. 23 the pharmacologic and behavioral processes 24 that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those 25 that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and specialty reporting, inc. 941-468-2779 / nancy@specialtyreporting.com 1 cocaine. and poly drug users, it means people who use 2 multiple drugs, and you ask them which one is the 3 hardest to quit, they will tell you that smoking is 4 harder to quit than alcohol or heroin or cocaine use. 5 without nicotine, people would not smoke. 6 without smoking, they would not have those diseases. 7 q. why do not you tell them which factor is the 8 most important to determine if a person is addicted or 9 has a nicotine addiction or is addicted to cigarettes 10 containing nicotine? 11 a. the most important factor is the number of 12 cigarettes smoked per day. 13 q. the warnings that occurred in the mid-'60s, i 14 want you to assume that most, if not all, of the 15 plaintiffs in these cases started smoking prior -- 16 regular smoking prior to the 1960s. 17 would those warnings for a person who is 18 addicted be much help? 19 a. no. well, that is the stage where basically 20 attitudes and beliefs are found, so that is the stage 21 before a child begins to smoke cigarettes, but during 22 which he is exposed to cigarettes in the environment, to 23 friends who smoke, family who smoke, movies, 24 advertisements, whatever they are exposed to, they are 25 developing their -- their beliefs and their ideas about specialty reporting, inc. 941-468-2779 / nancy@specialtyreporting.com 1 smoking. 2 q. prior to 1994, did they inform smokers that it 3 was an addictive drug? 4 a. i do not believe they informed smokers that it 5 was addictive. 6 q. did they mislead smokers in that regard? 7 a. yes, that is my opinion. fifty percent of people 8 start -- start with their first cigarette by age 15. 9 q. why is that important? 10 a. earlier you smoke, the more highly addicted 11 you are. 12 q. do you consider youth when they start smoking 13 to be informed smokers? 14 a. no. 15 q. the fact that cigarette companies 16 denied that -- that nicotine was addictive, did that 17 cause people to either start smoking or continue to 18 smoke? 19 a. well, it certainly undermined the informed 20 decision about it. so if there is was any hope of 21 making an informed decision about whether you should 22 start based on the benefits and risks and -- and someone 23 tells you who should know, well, you know, you can just 24 quit if you want to, that is reassuring when you start 25 smoking, that it is okay because you can minimize your specialty reporting, inc. 941-468-2779 / nancy@specialtyreporting.com 1 risk and just quit, when, in fact, most people do not 2 quit. 3 q. what is the difference between a bad habit, 4 going the mcdonald's, versus smoking cigarettes that 5 contain nicotine? 6 a. the difference is what is driving the behavior. 7 everyone has to eat. if you are nicotine addicted, 8 you have become dependent on a drug that you never, ever 9 had to have. you are using the substance -- the 10 cigarette, in this case -- to get nicotine. nicotine is 11 producing changes in your brain and your body that makes 12 you keep on using it. so your -- your behavior is not 13 simply a matter of willpower or moral strength. it is a 14 matter of a physiological physical addiction, and an 15 addiction to something that you never, ever had to have, 16 unlike food, which everyone has to eat." 17 mr. acosta: dr. benowitz was the senior 18 editor of one of those surgeon general's reports. 19 he was the one that was editor of addiction, 20 smoking and addiction, nicotine addiction. there 21 is not anybody that knows more than him about 22 nicotine addiction, and all those things that he 23 said were said so that people like you would be 24 informed about what nicotine really does. 25 mr. persons: objection, your honor. court: sustained. 2 mr. persons: and move to strike. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. acosta: he talked about the brain. this 5 was his slide. he talked about all these hormones 6 that get released, and then what happens when you 7 get hooked on cigarettes? your brain does not 8 release them anymore, so you feel bad. it is not a 9 matter of releasing a whole bunch of stuff, like 10 methamphetamine might. what happens is, it does not 11 release them during normal activities, so you wind 12 up smoking more and more and more so that you feel 13 normal. that is how it works. 14 so if you do not -- you do not smoke, the 15 nicotine does not fill the receptors. when it 16 does not fill the receptors but it is looking for 17 them, you feel bad, you feel -- you can feel really 18 pretty bad. 19 so people have to overcome that to stop 20 smoking. dr. benowitz says not everybody stops. i 21 showed you the dsm, that statistical manual. not 22 everybody stops. 23 we have a document from reynolds that is called 24 the nordine study, 1980, where one of their 25 directors says most people are not able to stop. they knew it. they knew it, and they did 2 everything they could to keep people smoking back 3 then. 4 you saw that. it shows how it affects 5 receptors, but it also changes these neuro 6 pathways. that is what dr. benowitz talked about. 7 then what do they do? instead of taking the 8 nicotine out, they intensify its effect. they make 9 it more potent. they do it by additives, to change 10 the form to freebase so that it will get to your 11 brain faster. 12 i mean, there is receptors all over your body. 13 if you pinch yourself, you feel it at the same time 14 you pinch yourself. it does not take eight seconds 15 for that to get there. it is instantaneous. when 16 the nicotine starts coming in, it is already telling 17 your brain, here it is. eight seconds later, the 18 actual drug is in your brain. that is what it does. 19 and it is the speed that makes it so addictive. 20 that is why people can wear a nicotine patch or take 21 nicotine gum and not get addicted to them. that is 22 called nicotine replacement therapy, which, for the 23 most part, was not available for mr. cavalier. it 24 came later. 25 he died in 1993. this is another reynolds document, r.j.r. 2 manipulates nicotine to addict and increase sales. 3 mr. persons: objection, your honor, to the 4 slide. 5 the court: can you -- 6 mr. acosta: well, there is evidence of this, 7 your honor, increase in physiological satisfaction. 8 the court: okay. that is fine. i'll 9 overrule. that is fine. 10 mr. acosta: that is their name for addiction. 11 that is what they put the ammonia in there for. 12 "satisfaction" is their code word for 13 "addiction." 14 you saw this. this was back a few years ago 15 but 48 million smokers at that time, seventy percent 16 want to quit. each year 17 million try to quit, 17 but only 3 percent succeed. i mean, that is the 18 statistic on it. this is not something that 19 somebody just made up. those are the facts. 20 now, i put this -- this is a medical record, 21 mr. cavalier's medical record. 22 and you heard from family members that he was 23 still smoking. he was not smoking five packs a day 24 after 1989, he was sneaking some cigarettes. he would 25 tell his doctors that he stopped smoking, that he quit smoking. they are going to tell him every 2 time he goes in, if he is smoking to not do it. 3 and he is telling them, well, i'm not. so he is 4 really trying hard, he is really trying hard; but 5 he is still sneaking a few. 6 the family members, when they are asked these 7 things in their depositions -- you know, lots of 8 questions get asked, and they get cherry-picked out 9 in a trial. 10 this says social history: he had been up to a 11 five-pack-a-day smoker, which he has tried to give 12 up. you do not say somebody "has tried to give it 13 up" unless they are still doing it. 14 they know, they know -- the cigarette industry 15 knew back in 1980 that addicted smokers do not have 16 a free choice, a free choice. this is their 17 document, this is them saying it. okay? it is not 18 me saying it. 19 dr. proctor: "tobacco lies helped kill thomas 20 cavalier." and that is true. 21 mr. persons: objection, your honor. it is 22 highly inflammatory, improper. 23 the court: overruled. you can proceed. 24 mr. acosta: let us play this short little 25 clip, because this is what their lies had to do with thomas cavalier. 2 3 "the narrator: tobacco and its use, 4 particularly in cigarettes. about heart disease, 5 dr. seltzer: 6 "dr. seltzer: i think where we stand now -- 7 the best we can say -- is that we do not know 8 whether or not there is a causal relationship 9 between smoking and heart disease." 10 (video clip stopped.) 11 mr. acosta: so think about it, what would 12 have happened if they had come out and said, look, 13 it causes heart disease, you should be aware of 14 that? 15 this is 1972. now, he was about 50 years old 16 at that point, been smoking since he was 15. 17 you heard dr. barnett, that you have to admit 18 that you do not start out smoking two packs a day. 19 it takes a while to get up there. 20 one of the records shows him at age 17 at two 21 packs or more a day. you do not get there right 22 away. he had to have started a lot earlier, and 23 one of his friends remembered him starting at 15. 24 mr. persons: objection, your honor, misstates 25 the evidence. court: sustained. 2 the clerk: 10 minutes, counsel. 3 mr. acosta: thank you. 4 they do it with billions of advertisements. 5 you saw this: the proof is in the pudding 6 here. 7 the sales -- the sales of cigarettes keep 8 climbing despite all this stuff you hear about, 9 despite all these warnings, despite all these 10 reader's digest articles, despite all that stuff, 11 sales are going up because they are being 12 overwhelmed by cigarette company messages and 13 advertising. 14 that is why sales go up. that proves it. that 15 proves it. it proves it was working. it proves 16 that what they did convinced a lot of people to 17 keep on smoking. and, of course, if you are 18 addicted, there is some hope that you are not going 19 to -- that -- that your -- that the company is 20 going to fix the problem. you keep smoking, hoping 21 that maybe they will. but they do not, and they 22 knew they could not. 23 this was from 1953. this is dr. teague, he 24 did that survey. look at all the cancer that he 25 found. so they conspire. in this statement, they 2 told the world that they agreed and they told 3 people that it did not cause cancer, that it was not 4 hazardous, and they were going to do some research 5 on the subject, just to make sure everybody would 6 know the true facts. it was a lie. it was a total 7 lie. 8 they -- this is 1959. they knew that they 9 could not take it all out. reynolds did. this is a 10 reynolds document. they could not take the bad 11 stuff out of the tobacco, but they kept telling 12 people they were going to work on it. 13 let us play this one. 14 15 "hugh cullman: so when we have today 60 16 percent of the business in the whole field compared 17 to 3 percent ten years ago, i think we need a 18 little more research. i'm convinced that 19 eventually they will find some element, through a 20 filter or through leaf growing or a special type of 21 seed that is growing, that will eliminate the 22 mysterious thing they are looking for. we want to 23 be the detective just as much as the surgeon 24 general or the ama. 25 speaker: are you saying then, sir, that there is something toxic about tobacco that is removable 2 by a filter? 3 hugh cullman: obviously, a filter takes out 4 certain tar and nicotine. i do not think the 5 industry admits there are any bad elements. if 6 there are bad elements, through our laboratories, 7 through the surgeon general, through the ama, 8 through acts of god, and luck, we hope we may find 9 them. and if they are found, they will be removed. 10 at this point we do not know. i do not think the 11 tobacco industry as a whole agrees with the 12 conclusions. 13 harry reasoner: $70 million a year is spent 14 to advertise cigarettes in all possible ways, 15 including radio and television. so far in the 16 developing concern about smoking and health, the 17 national reaction has been to keep smoking. 18 through the lifetimes of a lot of us, 19 cigarettes have been an intimate and reassuring 20 companion. the familiar slogans, the familiar 21 packages, have been a part of our lives. it is like 22 being told that an old friend has all along been 23 betraying you. in a case like that, you give the 24 old friend every chance before you finally decide 25 to believe what you have been told, and maybe even then, you give him a chance to reform. 2 (video clip stopped.) 3 mr. acosta: this is 1968. 1968. 4 5 mike wallace: good evening, i'm mike wallace. 6 the question of whether to smoke or not to smoke is 7 one of the most hotly debated controversies in the 8 country. 9 narrator: the cbs news national smoking test. 10 mike wallace: smokers tend to believe 11 statements which say the case is not proven. the 12 tobacco institute, an industry association, says 13 there is no biological proof, either experimental 14 or clinical, that smoking is the cause of diseases. 15 speaker: smokers tend to go along with the 16 tobacco institute, which says that certain 17 chemicals which may be harmful are more prevalent 18 in some polluted air than in cigarette smoke. 19 mike wallace: but the tobacco institute 20 believes that obesity, not cigarettes, is a major 21 factor in heart disease. it says several studies 22 have not shown any association between smoking and 23 heart disease. 24 speaker: finally, that you run a greater risk 25 crossing busy streets every day than smoking a pack of cigarettes every day. the tobacco institute 2 says there just is not documentation available and 3 they add: "until we know of any way in which 4 cigarette smoking is, in fact, harmful to health, 5 there is no way for us to say whether this 6 statement is anything more than just speculation." 7 (video clip stopped.) 8 9 narrator: from cbs washington in color, face 10 the nation, an unrehearsed news interview with 11 joseph cullman, iii, chairman of the executive 12 committee of the tobacco institute. 13 mr. cullman: we have no program that i know 14 of to try to help people to stop smoking. we do 15 talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes 16 are hazardous. we do not believe that cigarettes 17 are hazardous. we do not accept that. and that 18 this industry can face the future with confidence 19 because when, as, and if any ingredient in 20 cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious to 21 human health, we are confident we can eliminate 22 that ingredient. 23 (video clip stopped.) 24 mr. acosta: that was their story. and they 25 keep on with more and more and more of this on tv, newspapers. i cannot show it all to you all over 2 again but there is a lot of it, and they kept up 3 with that thing until they get to 1994 and the ceos 4 raise their hand and say it is not addictive. by 5 the way, it does not cause any disease either. 6 the clerk: five minutes, counsel. 7 mr. acosta: all right. thank you. 8 so we talked about this a little bit in the 9 opening: reynolds had choices too, you know? 10 do not blame it all on mr. cavalier. 11 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 12 the court: sustained. 13 mr. persons: motion. 14 the court: denied. 15 mr. acosta: blame them. they are the ones 16 that set this up. they are the ones that wanted 17 people to buy their products. they are the ones 18 that knew what was in them. they are the ones that 19 knew what it would do to people. they are the ones 20 that made it more addictive. they denied the 21 truth, they manipulated nicotine, and they chose 22 ammonia to freebase the nicotine. 23 and what do they do? this one is back when 24 thomas cavalier is a little boy, but it is the 25 beginning document that we have on this. it shows them marketing to kids, and they continued to do 2 that. they continued to market to kids. that was 3 how they replaced smokers. 4 you will see in the evidence that we put in, 5 there is a lot of documents that you have not seen 6 that are in evidence. that means you will get to 7 see them back there in the room if you want to, but 8 there is a lot of documents from the mid 1970s that 9 talk about products for the youth market. they 10 wanted to replace -- get youth to smoke, to induce 11 them to smoke through psychological means so that 12 they would start smoking and then get hooked. 13 it is in the documents. 14 here's this letter. in 1990, they are writing 15 schoolkids telling them that smoking does not cause 16 disease. 17 remember bill farone -- i'm going to go real 18 fast through this -- not all his opinions but he 19 worked at philip morris, but he knew what the whole 20 industry did. in fact, he is studied it since. 21 he is testified at the fda for the government. he is 22 an insider. he told you what they did and what 23 they knew, both about these nitrosamines, which got 24 a lot worse. 25 by the way, they were curing with propane gas just to save a nickel, but it made the cigarette a 2 lot more -- he said twice as carcinogenic. 3 it is disgusting. these people should be 4 punished -- not these lawyers, but the company. 5 the company should be punished for what it did, 6 because you know what punishment does? it acts as 7 a deterrent because, if the company knows that 8 another company got punished for lying to people 9 and doing bad things to them, then maybe they will not 10 do it. that is what it is for. that is exactly what 11 it is for. 12 he talked about these key problems, that they 13 could have -- even philip morris knew how to take 14 stuff like this out but they did not do it. they 15 did not want to change anything because they would 16 lose money. 17 the cigarette company defendants long had 18 firsthand knowledge of unreasonable cigarette 19 dangers while they were publicly denying it. 20 the cigarette company defendants knew how 21 addicting cigarettes are and exploited addiction 22 for profits. 23 the designs and methods that cigarette company 24 defendants use to make cigarettes were developed to 25 addict and to maintain the addiction of smokers despite the unreasonable danger. 2 each of the cigarette companies agreed with 3 the others that their cigarettes did not cause 4 cancer and were not addictive. 5 the cigarette industry knew how to remove or 6 to reduce harmful agents in cigarette smoke but 7 refused to do it. 8 and you might remember, farone talked about a 9 couple of cigarette brands that were relatively 10 safe or safe. they did not take the addictive ones 11 off the market. they did not take the nicotine out 12 of the addictive ones. 13 if the industry had done that across the 14 board, people would have a choice. people would 15 have a choice then. people have a choice whether 16 to smoke a pipe or to smoke a cigar. but when it 17 comes to cigarettes that you inhale that they made 18 inhaleable to do this, that is wrong. 19 the cigarette companies continue to conceal 20 and hide cigarette science and technology to make 21 it appear that what was available to them for years 22 is like new today, you know, like, oh, we are 23 discovering some new things. 24 well, they knew how to fix a cigarette a long, 25 long time ago by making it either uninhaleable or taking the nicotine out of it. they could have 2 done either one and people would have had a choice. 3 if you want to smoke tobacco, great, but they are 4 not going to be addicted to it. 5 so at the end, you are going to be asked to 6 fill out a verdict form and, obviously, we think 7 that you should fill out the form in our favor, and 8 that you should decide that punitive damages are 9 warranted. if you do that, we will have a very, 10 very short -- with maybe one witness -- evidentiary 11 hearing, a continuation of the trial that will be 12 done, most likely, tomorrow afternoon if you 13 finish -- if you have a verdict tonight. 14 if you do not have a verdict tonight -- and i'm 15 certainly not trying to suggest that you should do 16 anything other than fully deliberate until you 17 decide -- until you decide -- what you have here. 18 it is your decision. our job is just to give you 19 the information the best way we can so that you can 20 make that decision. thank you very much. 2 mr. gary: good afternoon, members of the 3 jury. i want to take this moment to -- and i do not 4 have much time, but i do want to say thank you. 5 you all have gone beyond the call of duty on this 6 case. you have been here day in and day out, and 7 you have shown a lot of interest in the case. so on 8 behalf of my client, ms. ann cavalier -- 9 will you stand, ms. cavalier, please? 10 -- i want to say thank you. 11 members of the jury, you know, this -- but for 12 your service, the system would not work. nobody 13 would get justice. and no matter what you do, do 14 what you feel you have to do. do what you feel is 15 right, and we can live with that, because i know, 16 and i believe, that our system of justice is one of 17 the best anywhere in the world. anywhere. and 18 ms. ann cavalier has been waiting on this system 19 for a long time. 20 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 21 the court: overruled. 22 mr. gary: years and years and years, and 23 members of the jury, it is time now -- you know, and 24 i think about all the time that has passed and what 25 she has been through and what she is going through, and maybe by some of the defendant's standard, they 2 talked about him in a way where -- i know he was 3 just a truck driver, but he was an american 4 citizen, members of the jury, and he fought in the 5 war for this country. and he did not just fight for 6 this country. he stood up for his country under 7 gun fire. he put a fellow soldier on his back and 8 walked miles and miles and miles. 9 now, let me just say this: with a third grade 10 education, that really did not matter, he wanted to 11 serve his country. you heard the testimony about 12 him trying to get in the navy, and he did not have 13 the education to do that. so he went to the army 14 and he got in and he served four years -- world 15 war ii -- and those were tough times, members of 16 the jury. 17 so i'm calling on you for him, because you owe 18 it to him. 19 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 20 the court: sustained. 21 mr. persons: and motion. 22 the court: denied. 23 mr. gary: justice, that is all. do not give 24 him nothing, just justice. give him a fair shot. 25 and members of the jury, i want to just say to you that these people may get away with this. 2 mr. persons: objection, your honor, 3 inflammatory. 4 the court: referring to the defendants? 5 mr. gary: defendants. 6 the court: that is fine. 7 mr. gary: because as demonstrated in the 8 case, they have the money, they have the power, 9 they have the resource. 10 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 11 the court: sustained. 12 mr. persons: and motion. 13 the court: denied. 14 mr. gary: members of the jury, they took 15 someone's deposition. this is one deposition. one 16 deposition. this is one statement. hundreds and 17 almost 600, 700 pages, in a deposition. that is 18 what they can do. and then they come in the 19 courtroom, because they know that all they have to 20 do is get you to say one word. 21 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 22 inappropriate. 23 the court: sustained. 24 mr. persons: and motion. 25 the court: denied. gary: on page so and so and so, you 2 did not say this, you did not say that. 3 mr. persons: same objection. 4 the court: overruled. 5 mr. gary: gotcha. 6 mr. persons: same objection. 7 the court: overruled. 8 mr. gary: members of the jury, they knew they 9 had these ingredients in smoke in that cigarette. 10 now, i'm a big boy. if i make my choice, i 11 live with it. anybody got a right to know what is 12 in your product because ain't no way you will know 13 but for whoever is selling to you tell you the 14 truth. and they lied. and i'm not talking about 15 the lawyers, i'm talking about reynolds. they lied 16 and they lied and they lied, and you know they 17 lied. and it is not right. and they want to get 18 away with it. 19 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 20 the court: overruled. 21 mr. gary: why could not they just tell you? 22 because otherwise you are going to say -- and it is 23 right to say it -- if you smoke, it is your choice, 24 you made it, live with it. do not lie and promise 25 something that you know you cannot deliver, a safe cigarette, when they knew -- their own documents, 2 members of the jury, their own documents. 3 their documents that were private, that they 4 had put under lock and key, their documents say -- 5 tell the story. they never thought we would get 6 these documents. these ain't my documents. what 7 do they say? destroy documents when you are 8 finished reading it. 9 now why would you say something like that? 10 mr. persons: objection. may we -- 11 the court: sure, approach, mr. persons. the 12 judge wants to see them. let me take a look. 13 before the 14 court at the bench and out of the hearing of the 15 jury.) 16 ms. schneider: there is nothing in evidence 17 that says this. there is no documents on this -- 18 mr. gary: they did -- 19 the court: the only one i'm concerned about, 20 number 4. that is the only one. 21 mr. gary: it was in there. it was in there. 22 ms. schneider: yeah -- 23 the court: mr. acosta, number 4, that is the 24 only one i'm concerned about. which documents does 25 that relate to? acosta: this is the -- 2 the court: switzerland. that is fine. so 3 objection is overruled then, that is fine. 4 counsel, if you want to go over to this side, 5 you are welcome to do that as well. 6 in open 7 court before the court and jury.) 8 the court: objection is overruled. 9 mr. gary: thank you, your honor. 10 members of the jury -- 11 the court: hold on, hold on. let me look at 12 it. not a problem, i'm happy to look. that is my 13 job. 14 mr. persons: we want you to look at it. 15 the court: not a problem. 16 that is the only one. that is the only one, 17 take out 27. that is fine. 18 ms. schneider: there is no dollar sign. it is 19 40 million cigarettes. 20 the court: okay. that is fine. can we 21 just -- just the last two, just cross those out. 22 otherwise, it is fine. okay? 23 mr. gary: take out what, 40, 50? 24 the court: the dollar sign. that is a typo. 25 ms. schneider: it is 40 million cigarettes. acosta: this has to come out. she is 2 ruled on that. 3 the court: but otherwise, it is fine. 4 mr. acosta: we will get it straight. 5 mr. gary: you do that one. thank you, your 6 honor. 7 in open 8 court before the court and jury.) 9 mr. gary: may i continue? 10 the court: of course. you may continue. 11 mr. gary: members of the jury, you take a 12 peek. look at some of the stuff that they did, and 13 they want you, they want you, to say to this man, 14 no justice. that ain't right. it is not right, 15 members of the jury, and they know about it. you 16 look at it. 17 this is what they were doing. they were -- 18 this is what -- i'm not talking about the lawyers, 19 they are good people, but these people, these 20 tobacco people, bad people, what they are. 480,000 21 people die every year from their foolishness. 22 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 23 the court: overruled. 24 mr. gary: you heard dr. farone say, they can 25 make a safer cigarette. i'm saying, you can say, well, you buy anything i sell, but you are going to 2 sell me some poison and not tell me? it is not 3 right. members of the jury, that is not right. and 4 they know it. 5 that is why in this case, i'm going to tell you 6 right now, i told you-all when we were picking the 7 jury in this case, the damages was going to be -- 8 $10 million is what we are going to be seeking in 9 damages, $10 million, and you may decide that is not 10 enough and you can do more, $10 million. and it 11 may not be enough. 12 members of the jury, why do they put the lady, 13 nice lady, i got nothing against her, up there 14 today and say this was not -- there was no 15 addiction? 16 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 17 the court: overruled. 18 mr. persons: attacked the defense's case. 19 the court: overruled. 20 mr. chestnut: your honor, can i have an 21 objection to speaking objections? 22 the court: sustained. 23 mr. gary: why did they have her say -- now, 24 that is playing on your intelligence. 25 mr. persons: objection. court: overruled. 2 mr. gary: ladies and gentlemen, how can 3 anybody smoke 100 cigarettes a day and not be 4 addicted? dr. feingold told you, these people 5 ain't stupid. president kennedy was smoking 6 cigarettes. they did not know because these people 7 were lying to them. they are liars, bald-faced 8 liars. 9 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 10 the court: overruled. 11 mr. persons: inflammatory. 12 mr. gary: if punitive damages were ever 13 warranted in a case, it is this case. bragging 14 about it. it is not right, members of the jury. 15 it is not right. 16 and let me tell you where the big fight is 17 with me. there is our kids over there in a foxhole 18 fighting for their country, and they give them 19 rations, 16 cigarettes every single day. 20 mr. persons: objection, no evidence. 21 the court: overruled. 22 mr. gary: thank you, your honor. 23 16 a day. they can run but they cannot hide. 24 16 a day. do you know how old these kids were? 25 they were 18 and 19 years old, fighting for their country, and i'm going to show you some letters 2 where they wrote to reynolds after they got out 3 saying, "look, why y'all tricked us? gave us all 4 these cigarettes? we did not even want to smoke. 5 and you said they were safe. you said they was 6 okay. we trusted you." 7 well, guess what? reynolds did not even answer 8 their letter. all the veterans got together; 9 would not even answer their letter, members of the 10 jury, would not do it. 11 you know this is addiction. even if you blame 12 him for it, it is addiction. they got up there 13 under oath and said it was not addiction. now, 14 that is not right, tell the truth, and we will live 15 with the truth. if it says nothing, that is okay, 16 we will live with that, but tell the truth. do not 17 get up here and tell one lie after another. 18 how can anybody on god's earth smoke 100 19 cigarettes a day and not be addicted? that is 20 totally impossible. members of the jury, this is 21 the engle finding. it ain't one of gary's 22 findings. this is an engle finding. and some of 23 you said, well, where did it come from? how did it 24 happen? 25 this is a court finding. this is -- once you find out they are a member of the class, this is 2 the law. nicotine in cigarettes is addictive. 3 well, what did they say about it? they knew 4 it was addictive, members of the jury. 5 play the tape, judge, real quick, play the 6 tape, washington, d.c., where they went to d.c., 7 took the oath, swore to tell the truth and nothing 8 but the truth, so help them god, and they lied. 9 they lied. and only thing i'm saying, i'm a big 10 boy, i own up to my own doings, but you cannot lie 11 and get away with it. 12 13 mr. wyden: let me begin my questioning on the 14 matter of whether or not nicotine is addictive. 15 let me ask you first, i'd like to just go down the 16 row, whether each of you believes that nicotine is 17 not addictive. 18 i heard virtually all of you touch on it. 19 just yes or no. do you believe nicotine is not 20 addictive? 21 mr. campbell: i believe nicotine is not 22 addictive, yes. 23 mr. wyden: mr. johnston. 24 mr. j. johnston: congressman, cigarettes and 25 nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definitions of addiction. there is no 2 intoxication. 3 mr. wyden: we will take that as a no. and, 4 again, time is short. i think each of you believe 5 nicotine is not addictive, and we just would like 6 to have this for the record. 7 mr. taddeo: i do not believe that nicotine 8 products are addictive. 9 mr. horrigan: i believe nicotine is not 10 addictive. 11 mr. tisch: i believe that nicotine is not 12 addictive. 13 mr. sandefur: i believe that nicotine is not 14 addictive. 15 mr. d. johnston: and i, too, believe that 16 nicotine is not addictive. 17 (video clip stopped.) 18 mr. gary: now, you want to know where the 19 conspiracy comes from, do not you? members of the 20 jury, that is why they got busted. they teamed up, 21 they teamed up, and told lies. do not take my word 22 for it. read the engle finding. just read it 23 briefly. just read it. and i'm coming down to 24 you. 25 but, members of the jury, we did not drum this up. the defendants, they ain't just talking about 2 reynolds, they are talking about all of them, they 3 all got busted. 4 mr. persons: objection, your honor, criminal 5 activity. 6 the court: overruled. 7 mr. gary: the defendants agreed to conceal. 8 now, members of the jury, that is bad, and you know 9 it is. why would you conceal going to sell 10 somebody something and conceal something, 11 information about a product that could kill 12 somebody? just because you think you can get away 13 with it. 14 what does this one say? same thing. they 15 omitted material information otherwise known. i 16 told you this was a case about fraud and false -- 17 knowing that the material was false or misleading, 18 they misled this young boy, and it ain't right, and 19 you know it is not. they misled him. 20 all they had to do was tell him the truth, and 21 then if he wanted to smoke, it was his choice, let 22 him smoke, that is all right. but he is dead and 23 he is gone. 480,000 people every year going down 24 because of their actions. 25 members of the jury, you got the power to stop this. you could put your foot down. 2 mr. persons: objection, your honor, jury 3 nullification. 4 the court: sustained. 5 mr. persons: motion. 6 the court: denied. 7 mr. gary: let me just tell you something. 8 you have a lot of power, and do not you 9 underestimate it. you have the power to see the 10 wrong and make it right. you can see suffering and 11 you can stop it. 12 mr. persons: objection. injecting religion 13 into the case. 14 the court: sustained. 15 mr. gary: ain't no religion. 16 mr. persons: objection. 17 the court: that is okay. we will just move 18 forward. 19 mr. gary: you have the power to do that, 20 members of the jury. 21 let me talk about something that is really near 22 and dear to me, real near and dear to me. no 23 matter what you do, this will still be near and 24 dear to me. my children. 25 mr. persons: objection, your honor, conscienceless. 2 the court: overruled. 3 mr. gary: thank you. this case is about 4 fraud. it is about lying. they did not just lie to 5 adults, but they lied to children. they lied, 6 members of the jury, and they knew they lied. 7 school days. 8 ms. schneider: your honor, this is opening, 9 and it is a problem. 10 mr. persons: we had the same issue. 11 the court: it is overruled now. this is 12 closing. 13 mr. gary: now, members of the jury, bear with 14 me for a second. 15 put it back up. 16 school days. either one of them. it is okay. 17 now, members of the jury, let me -- you know, just 18 put one of the school days up again. 19 because i want you to see the date. you are 20 talking about mr. cavalier, he did this, and he was 21 35 years old when he first did this. that is 22 hogwash, okay?

15 okay. i'm sorry. restroom break. 16 so let us take a quick five-minute restroom 17 break, everyone. 18 our poor deputy has got to run around. he is 19 getting his exercise. 20 (the jury exited the courtroom at 3:29 p.m.) 21 (discussion off the record.) 22 (recess from 3:29 p.m. until 3:37 p.m.) 23 the court: mr. gary, are you ready?

do they have the right to do that? and then 21 they are going to get up here and tell you, "well, 22 what does that have to do with mr. cavalier?" 23 well, he was not mr. cavalier then, he was 24 tommy. he was little tommy. see, they are going 25 to fast-forward you like he had all this right to make this decision. 2 but members of the jury, when people get 3 addicted, it is easy to say "just stop. just stop." 4 but that is not like -- it ain't that easy. a lot 5 of people try over and over and over again, and 6 they just cannot. and then they want to kick them. 7 they got a drug habit. they are selling the drug. 8 then they want to blame the people who cannot kick 9 the habit. 10 then you told them all of their life that it is 11 safe. it is all right. there is no nicotine. and 12 you will not get addicted. and they believe you. and 13 then you call them crazy and stupid for believing 14 you. and it is your fault. you made the choice. 15 they do not have the right to do that, members 16 of the jury, and then go seek, search and find our 17 children? 18 and here -- and when we are talking -- look, 19 do not go for this thing, well, it ain't -- it is 20 just reynolds. it ain't the other companies. they 21 are all in it together. it is a conspiracy. that is 22 what it says, "a conspiracy." they got cited for 23 conspiring to lie to people about their product, 24 about how safe it was. they did not tell the truth. 25 and all they had to do was just tell the truth. and then if you make a choice, it is your 2 choice. but you cannot blame me for making a choice 3 when i'm misled or you are withholding information. 4 look here, they got his children. 5 fast-forward. the cigarette people, they are all 6 in it together, members of the jury, it is a 7 conspiracy. do not go for this "well, it ain't -- 8 it is not reynolds. it is someone else." no, no, 9 no, no, no. that is conspiracy, and from the engle 10 findings, are for all of them together. 11 now, look at -- you tell about kids in 12 training, and it gets worse than that. these 13 are -- they give these kids these gift packs 14 with -- real cigarette packs, got them with them in 15 their mouths. look at the two young ladies, the 16 sisters, they are back here in the courtroom. you 17 started them early. they knew what they were 18 doing. they got the money. they do the 19 advertising. they do the focus groups. they do 20 all that stuff. they knew what they were doing. 21 now, before i go there, let me just -- let me 22 just -- you are talking about in training. 23 help me out here so i can move a little 24 faster. 25 this is real. this is real. he did not have a chance. because he started back here. they get 2 you. they get you. and then they want to say "you 3 made the choice. you made the choice. you did not 4 have to do it." 5 real packs. real packs. i mean they shared 6 their -- their -- their private secrets with them 7 in terms of the -- the makeup of their packs and 8 the cigarettes and all that. you had the little 9 tip that look just like a cigarette. and some of 10 them like you could blow the smoke out of them. i 11 mean, they were going after these kids. 12 and members of the jury, you are going to see 13 and i may not get to it, but i've got boards from 14 their own documents, from their own archives, from 15 their own cabinets, where they are saying we 16 need -- if we do not get the kids, we are going to go 17 out -- we are going to lose a lot of money. we have 18 got to get them. these are -- put them in 19 training, because guess what, the others are going 20 to die. [#deleted objection dialogue#] 10 mr. gary: tobacco is a relatively efficient 11 nicotine delivery system. nicotine is a drug, 12 members of the jury. how do they get away with it, 13 you tell me, without telling the truth? 14 the government never agreed to let you do it 15 with -- and lie about it. they agreed to let you 16 do it, but you had to tell the truth. they lied to 17 the government. 18 where do we go from here? our obvious route 19 is to give people more nicotine if the tar is 20 reduced. one way or the other, we are going to get 21 you. you are going to get hooked. 22 think about those young boys coming back from 23 the war, wrote them, asking them to say -- to tell 24 them why all our people are dying from cancer. 25 members of the jury, some of them stayed over there and they fought, dodging bombs and bullets, 2 ducking bombs and bullets, come back to die a 3 dishonor -- they got an honorable discharge, and 4 they came back to die a dishonorable death. 5 mr. persons: objection, your honor, no 6 evidence. 7 the court: sustained. 8 mr. gary: increase the nicotine. now they are 9 talking about, in snowing you, "well, it is already 10 in the tobacco. we take it out and we just put it 11 back in." but does this say increase here? they 12 are talking about increasing the nicotine. and 13 that is what -- and they already increased it. they 14 want to increase it more. these are their 15 documents. 16 see, because members of the jury, i want you 17 all to know one thing, all these documents we are 18 showing you, we did not go out and find them. they 19 had to give them up by law. 20 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 21 the court: sustained. 22 mr. persons: and motion. 23 the court: sustained. i'll deny the motion. 24 mr. gary: their documents, can you believe 25 that?

12 the court: you are keeping it up. 13 mr. gary: within 10 seconds of starting to 14 smoke nicotine is available in your brain. think 15 about it. 16 10 seconds. 17 and you are doing 100 of these a day. and 18 that -- the expert lady came in here and said, "oh, 19 he was not addicted." now, that should have been 20 the point where you should say, "hey, wait a 21 minute. we ain't stupid." because that is playing 22 on your intelligence. 23 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 24 the court: sustained. 25 mr. gary: let us look at what we are currently -- now, members of the jury, this is one 2 of their records -- one of their records. they -- 3 you heard me talk about they did not want to go 4 through -- they went and started a research company 5 all the way over in -- what -- what -- country was 6 that? germany. and guess why they did it? they 7 said because we do not want them to be able to 8 subpoena our records. they knew what they was 9 doing. they knew what they were doing. 10 before starting on any future scenario, the 11 marketing scenario, let us look at what we are 12 currently selling and where and how it has 13 developed. 14 a cigarette as a drug administration system 15 for public use has very, very significant 16 advantages. 17 this is what we are dealing with, members of 18 the jury. these are their records they never 19 thought would see the light of day. 20 different people smoke cigarettes for 21 different reasons. 22 ms. schneider: objection, your honor, this is 23 not in evidence. 24 the court: okay. let us move forward. 25 mr. gary: now, here they are giving impression -- members of the jury, dr. proctor told 2 you about how they paid people off, the 3 politicians. oh, they had the power, and they 4 could get done what they needed to get done. 5 mr. persons: objection. 6 the court: overruled. 7 mr. gary: they paid doctors. 8 the court: you can continue. 9 mr. gary: thank you, your honor. 10 they got doctors. the nerve of them putting 11 out information that is saying that it -- if you 12 smoke this type cigarette, it is safer for you if 13 you are pregnant for your baby. now, that is a 14 flat-out lie, and they knew they was lying to sell 15 cigarettes -- to sell cigarettes. unborn baby. 16 mr. persons: objection, your honor, no 17 evidence. 18 the court: sustained. 19 mr. persons: and motion. 20 the court: denied. 21 mr. gary: i've been talking about choice, 22 right?

"and we also got to 18 tell people that it is safer, we got cigarettes 19 that is really" -- they were telling people that if 20 you smoke our cigarettes, it will kill you. if you 21 had an ailment, it would make you well. i mean, 22 they had people buying cigarettes for all kinds of 23 reasons. and it is okay, members of the jury, if 24 you buy the product because you are informed and 25 you know what it is and you are an adult, that is okay. you buy this, it is your fault because they 2 told you the truth. 3 and, members of the jury, you see commercials 4 on television. right now they will tell you 5 everything that can happen with that product. 6 they -- because they want to you make an informed 7 decision. you cannot have somebody taking a drug 8 that you do not tell them about that it is a drug and 9 you do not tell what is in it. they was not telling 10 nobody. even back then, i'm talking about back in 11 the '40s, '50s, and '60s, and even the '70s. 12 and just remember this: there was no warning, 13 because they stand behind the warning. now, one 14 that they did not even want, they fought against it, 15 they said they did not need it, but now they stand 16 behind it. "aha, we had a warning." 17 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 18 the court: overruled. 19 mr. gary: and members of the jury, they 20 did not get a warning until 1965. by this time, 21 mr. cavalier had been smoking 20-plus, 35 years. 22 sad to say, but this war veteran was -- was sick. 23 dr. proctor said it, and dr. feingold said it, and 24 dr. farone said it, and even -- even -- even some 25 of their witnesses said, "heart disease, smoking; liver disease, smoking; copd, smoking." 2 and, members of the jury, that smoke, you saw 3 what was in it. it is like a train wreck inside of 4 your body. you think it is just going to hit one 5 organ and stop. it is like a train wreck. it -- it 6 spares nothing. it gets all in your system. 7 mr. persons: objection, your honor, 8 misstatement of the evidence. 9 the court: overruled. 10 mr. gary: you can count on us. after that 11 meeting, "do not worry about a thing. we have got 12 your back. you can count on us. if we find 13 anything in it that is not good, we will tell you 14 about it." 15 and they already knew it was cancerous. they 16 knew it had carcinogens in it. they knew it when 17 they were telling this bald-faced lie. 18 that came from their documents. 19 ms. schneider: no, your honor, this is not in 20 evidence. 21 the court: okay. let us move forward. 22 it is sustained. 23 ms. schneider: no, your honor, this is not in 24 evidence. 25 the court: sustained. ms. schneider: no, your honor, this is not in 2 evidence. 3 the court: it is a demonstrative. 4 mr. hohnbaum: objection to the previous 5 document. 6 the court: okay. that is fine. sustain the 7 previous one. this is fine. this is fine. 8 mr. gary: say what now? 9 the court: you can proceed. i'm sorry, 10 mr. gary. 11 mr. gary: oh, okay. 12 members of the jury, they are talking about all 13 the poisons that are later discovered in a 14 cigarette. let me ask you this: how does anybody 15 get a chance to get away with having a product 16 that is got poison in it and not tell you about it 17 and you buy it and they blame you for believing 18 them? 19 mr. persons: objection. 20 the court: overruled. 21 mr. gary: you heard of all the poisons. what 22 is a poison? it kills. 480,000 deaths every year 23 to smoke, 480,000, and they just want you to take 24 it like it is a grain of salt. it is not a big deal. 25 mr. persons: objection, your honor. court: overruled. 2 mr. gary: now, why would you hide all this? 3 you want to talk about you want people to make a 4 choice, an informed choice, why would you hide all 5 of this? 6 ms. schneider: your honor, this is not in 7 evidence. this is the one we actually had the huge 8 argument about. 9 the court: sustained. 10 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 11 the court: overruled. 12 mr. gary: they wrote them the letter, to 13 reynolds, said, "why did y'all do it to us? you 14 gave us 16 cigarettes a day." i mean, why did they 15 have to give them so many a day? why did not they 16 just, for that matter, one or two? they were 17 trying to get them hooked because they wanted 18 customers when they got back home. now, these 19 young men and woman fought and they -- some died 20 for their country, and that is what they got. 21 but these defendants took the position, "oh, 22 yeah, we will go in and litigate it." 23 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 24 the court: sustained. 25 mr. persons: motion. court: denied. 2 mr. gary: there are the rations, breakfast, 3 lunch, and dinner. 4 mr. persons: objection, your honor. no 5 evidence. no foundation for it. 6 the court: overruled. 7 mr. gary: that is what they were doing. the 8 truth hurts. 9 mr. persons: objection. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. persons: motion. 12 the court: denied. 13 mr. gary: here is the letter: "veterans of 14 foreign affairs. we all remember that during world 15 war ii, we were given all the cigarettes we needed, 16 and many young men and women started the smoking 17 habit who had never smoked before who never ever 18 intended to smoke." 19 they got them. they got them. 20 the court: mr. gary, eight minutes. 21 mr. gary: thank you, your honor. 22 right after the war, when we got home, in 23 essence, members of the jury, they found out that 24 something was wrong. they had been conversing with 25 them, selling them cigarettes, doing all kinds of stuff. then when they got called on the carpet 2 about the lies they had told these young men and 3 women, they lied to us about the doctor said it was 4 okay, and then they found -- reynolds -- let me 5 tell you something. what reynolds did, what these 6 people did, when they first found out -- they were 7 given -- see, part of -- part of their -- how they 8 were going to snow people, they said -- 9 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. gary: they said, "we are going to give you 12 grants to do research." that is what they said, and 13 they told the public that. but they got certain 14 people to do it. and then when these people 15 started finding -- started discovering that these 16 cigarettes were causing cancer, man, they fired 17 those people so fast your head would swim. "get 18 out of here. we ain't looking for no truth." 19 mr. persons: objection. 20 the court: overruled. 21 mr. gary: we got -- these kids said, "we 22 thought you said your doctors said it was okay. we 23 would like to have a full report from research men 24 of the tobacco companies who were familiar with 25 testing and examining" -- look. you test and why you examine your own product because they still 2 wanted to believe the lies, the lies, they wanted 3 to believe them. but now they are getting 4 concerned because they found out there was cancer 5 in this stuff. 6 "trusting you will favor us with a reply." 7 they did not even answer these kids. 8 mr. persons: objection; "kids." 9 the court: overruled. 10 mr. gary: did not even answer them. 11 the court: five minutes, mr. gary. 12 mr. gary: how many, your honor? 13 ms. schneider: your honor, this is not in 14 evidence. 15 the court: okay. sustained. 16 mr. gary: members of the jury, there are 17 going to be two phases, but the second phase is 18 going to be short. 19 ms. schneider: object, your honor; "two 20 phases. " 21 the court: overruled. 22 mr. gary: the first question you got to 23 answer: "was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of 24 thomas cavalier's coronary heart disease, and if 25 so" -- "and if so, was coronary heart disease a legal cause of his death." 2 members of the jury, you have heard -- i'm not 3 going to go over all the testimony again. you 4 heard their own witness say -- she said this 5 morning, heart disease, copd, and liver disease, so 6 you can check that "yes." 7 then after checking that "yes," you will go on 8 to number 2: "was thomas cavalier addicted to 9 cigarettes containing nicotine?" 10 now, you know we have proven that. you know 11 we have proven it and ain't nothing they can say 12 about that. 13 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 14 the court: sustained. 15 mr. gary: "did thomas cavalier reasonably 16 rely to his detriment" -- now, you wanted me -- do 17 i have to go through the engle findings again, 18 where they trumped up stuff, they lied, they 19 withheld information that was detrimental? 20 "detriment" means to your detriment, withholding 21 information that could lead to your death, and they 22 still would not give it up. 23 "did thomas cavalier reasonably rely to his 24 detriment on either a statement or omission of 25 material" -- you know they were running around talking -- they are in congress, on -- on every air 2 wave in the world lying about nicotine was not 3 addictive, and that their cigarettes were safe. 4 they were lying all over the place. he does not 5 have a voice now because he is dead and he is gone. 6 mr. persons: objection. 7 the court: overruled. 8 mr. gary: but you can be the voice. 9 mr. persons: objection. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. persons: motion. 12 the court: denied. 13 mr. gary: "did thomas cavalier reasonably 14 rely to his detriment" -- he is dead -- "on either a 15 statement or omission made in furtherance of r.j. 16 reynolds," and there were many others, "agreement 17 to conceal material information not otherwise known 18 or available concerning the health effects or 19 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, and if so, 20 was such reliance a legal cause of mr. cavalier's 21 coronary heart disease?" 22 members of the jury, you heard from the 23 family. they knew a lot of things, but they did not 24 know that this smoke had all these chemicals in it. 25 they did not know that this smoke could kill you like it is killing 400 -- you think 480,000 people 2 would just go out and use a product every year? 3 these people are dying now because they started 30 4 years ago. 5 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 6 the court: overruled. 7 mr. gary, one minute. would you like to use 8 more time from your rebuttal?

and she is got the scales 2 that are even, y'all remember we talked about that 3 when we were picking the jury, and she is got a 4 sword in the other hand, and she is blindfolded. do 5 you know why she is blindfolded? she is blindfolded 6 because she does not even want to see who you are if 7 you are seeking justice. your color does not 8 matter. 9 mr. persons: objection. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. persons: and motion. 12 the court: denied. 13 mr. gary: she does not want to see who you 14 are. she just wants to know that it is about 15 justice. 16 so in years to come, because you are going to 17 build some relationships here that is going to last, 18 that is going to withstand the test of time. oh, 19 yeah. this ain't all about mr. cavalier. this is 20 about a whole lot here, this is about making a 21 difference. this is about -- 22 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 23 the court: sustained. 24 mr. persons: and motion. 25 the court: denied. gary: members of the jury, i mean, i've 2 seen the bonding, you know, and it is great. it is 3 just real -- it really is. i mean, the closeness. 4 you-all will be friends for life. it is not this -- 5 so this is a good thing for you, and that is why i 6 say, you know, just do what is in your heart, do the 7 right thing, and we -- that is all anybody can ask 8 for. 9 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. persons: motion. 12 the court: denied. 13 mr. gary: when it comes to justice, just do 14 what you feel is fair and what is right. 15 and then, members of the jury, when it is all 16 said and done, be proud. you be proud of your 17 verdict. 18 mr. persons: objection. 19 the court: overruled. 20 mr. gary: be proud because this is america, 21 the home of the brave and the free. this is 22 america, and only in america, only in america, can 23 a truckdriver, a truckdriver, did not have any 24 education, maybe two, three years, but you heard 25 the testimony about thomas cavalier. even witness today said that he was a hard worker. he 2 worked every day, members of the jury. he 3 was not -- every single day he worked. even 4 sometimes 7:00 -- early in the morning, come back 5 as late as 7:00 at night, and then they are going 6 to get up and say, well, he was watching tv and... 7 another thing about this, did he have 8 knowledge of what was going on. reader's digest, 9 they had 400 pages, they probably had one paragraph 10 about smoking. reader's digest. it was in the 11 newspaper. they keep talking about, well, you are 12 in new york where all the stuff goes down, you 13 should have known about smoking, you should have 14 known this, known that. 15 what was reynolds doing? let them show you 16 one ad that they put in the papers telling people 17 about these chemicals that were in cigarettes. 18 when they get up here and talk to you, say show me 19 one ad, do not tell me about what somebody's put in 20 the paper, what was in the local news, what was in 21 the local newspaper, show me what you did to say to 22 people, they talk about oh, it is a cancer stick, 23 they knew this from 100 years ago and all that 24 stuff, and they have not put one article in the 25 paper yet, they have not said one thing, and they are going to have you believe they should have 2 known because it was in the local paper, it was on 3 the legal news, it was on this, it was on that. 4 but what did reynolds do? and when they come up 5 here with that, you ask that question to yourself 6 and see what kind of answer that you get, other 7 than the fact that they lied and said they were 8 going to put money in research and as soon as they 9 got research they did not like, they fired 10 everybody. they even killed the rats. 11 mr. persons: objection. 12 the court: overruled. 13 mr. gary: justice. justice. justice. 14 justice, that is the heart and saul of the american 15 jury system. if anybody should question you, it 16 may be years to come, about this trial, i want you 17 to say i was there? our courtroom in west palm 18 beach, florida, and i gave little tommy, little 19 tommy, the war veteran that went half a mile with 20 his friend on his back with a soldier on his back, 21 fighting for his country, that is right. i want you 22 to say i was there and i tried to do the right 23 thing, i gave him justice that was the heart and 24 soul of the american dream. 25 mr. persons: objection 124689 overruled. gary: thank you, thank you. 14 mr. chestnut: good afternoon, ladies and 15 gentlemen. as the judge said, we are in the home 16 stretch, so i'll try to summarize everything up 17 real quick. 18 so i'm tasked with giving a rebuttal to some 19 of the things you heard in closing arguments, 20 ladies and gentlemen. and there was so much 21 misinformation, it was difficult for me, obviously, 22 to know where to start. so let us just start with 23 r.j. reynolds. 24 but i think, you know, this picture of the 25 plaza hotel probably sums it up best, ladies and gentlemen. because, in 1955, when the execs are 2 meeting, in the penthouse of the plaza hotel there 3 is a 22-year-old truck driver who is making 4 deliveries in the city of new york, smoking the 5 cigarettes, a victim of the very conspiracy this 6 industry is perpetuating, that r.j. reynolds was a 7 participant in. 8 r.j. reynolds, these are old school players, 9 but you know what the problem with old school 10 players is? this is the dotcom age. old school 11 players do not accept the evidence. you catch 12 somebody speeding back in the day, they say, oh, 13 no, officer, that was not me. 14 but i clocked you. 15 no, that was not me. 16 i clocked you with a laser and there is nobody 17 else on the road. 18 or somebody is cheating on their girlfriend 19 and say, oh, it was not me. what do they do? old 20 school players do three things: lie, deny, then 21 blame the victim. that was not me. 22 in 2015 -- that might work in '55, but in 23 2015, what happens? no, no, this is an instagram 24 picture and that is your tattoo and that is the shirt 25 i bought you. ladies and gentlemen, that is what is happening 2 today. 3 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 4 the court: sustained. 5 mr. persons: i have a motion. 6 the court: denied. 7 mr. chestnut: i'm talking about 8 r.j. reynolds, not the attorneys. i'm talking 9 about r.j. reynolds, the company. r.j. reynolds 10 whoever he is, that person. 11 members of the jury, let us just go through. 12 now, these are self-prescribed lies. they told us 13 in '55 during that conspiracy that they were 14 developing a conspiracy for what? litigation, 15 politics, and public opinion. what are they doing? 16 our basic position is: cigarette controversy. 17 here's what important, that we are making false or 18 misleading statements to promote the sale of 19 cigarettes. 20 this is an internal r.j.r. -- i'm sorry, this 21 is a tobacco institute document, confidential, 22 where they are calling themselves liars. we do not 23 have to do it. they are doing it. [#deleted objection dialogue#] 10 mr. chestnut: -- documents internal or that 11 belong to the tobacco industry. 12 let us ask this, ladies and gentlemen: let us 13 look at how come none of their experts explained to 14 you any of these documents from any of the tobacco 15 companies? running -- their documents were running 16 from the documents. 17 mr. persons: objection. 18 the court: denied. 19 mr. chestnut: let us go through and let us talk 20 about addiction. so we will do a credibility of 21 witnesses first, ladies and gentlemen. 22 dr. -- i tell you what, 508192, there was a 23 question if mr. cavalier was addicted. here's a 24 document, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of what 25 test you want to employ, here is a document by james w. lea where it says "social history. 2 192. thank you. 3 five pack a day, which he has tried to give 4 up. he tried to quit, he could not quit. 5 how about 133, brian. 6 he is a -- he is a heavy nicotine abuse smoker, 7 five packs a day. this is another doctor, dr. lea, 8 saying he has nicotine abuse. now, they brought in 9 a psychiatrist to -- 10 can we go to the slides. 11 -- to talk to you about addiction, to testify 12 to you, ladies and gentlemen, that mr. cavalier 13 was not addicted. first of all, let us talk about 14 credibility of witnesses. they did not produce a 15 witness to you that was not on their payroll. the 16 two people they put in front of you, they paid. 17 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 18 the court: overruled. 19 mr. chestnut: now, five packs a day, 100 20 cigarettes per day, for a 160 pack-years. in 21 mr. cavalier's life, he had 7,340 cigarettes times 22 160 years; 1.6 8 million cigarettes, 11.68 puffs, 23 and she is saying he is not addicted. 24 can we go to the slides? 1439. 25 now, the psychiatrist they brought in did -- did not speak at all to their documents. we will come 2 back to it. 3 mr. gary: there it is. 4 ms. schneider: your honor, this is not in 5 evidence. 6 the court: sustained. 7 mr. chestnut: here's a memo from the planning 8 committee. "it is unfortunate for us that 9 cigarettes are a habit they cannot break." this is 10 a tobacco document. they brought in an expert to 11 say tobacco is not addictive, mr. cavalier did is 12 not addicted. 13 why did not they explain this document? it is 14 their document. nobody's ever become -- 15 ms. schneider: this document is not in 16 evidence. 17 the court: sustained. 18 mr. chestnut: "cigarette is more addictive 19 than using heroin." 20 ms. schneider: your honor, this is not in 21 evidence. 22 mr. acosta: i think this one was. 23 mr. chestnut: narcotic value that -- 24 ms. schneider: your honor, this is not in 25 evidence. the court: sustained. 2 ms. schneider: this is not in evidence. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. acosta: two slides back was in evidence, 5 "structure of creativity group." 6 mr. chestnut: your honor, is the death 7 certificate in evidence? 8 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 9 mr. persons: objection. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. chestnut: just wanted to confirm before i 12 publish it. 13 can i have c 1? 14 now, members of the jury, let us just be 15 consistent. the question ultimately is -- and 16 you have been over the verdict form a number of 17 times -- it is "a" versus "the." when we look at 18 the definition of both of these, "a" means it has 19 to be one of many causes. "the" means it is the 20 only cause. indefinite, definite. 21 the jury instruction -- every instruction says 22 "a," that smoking was a cause -- 23 mr. hohnbaum: a legal cause. 24 the court: overruled. 25 mr. chestnut: your honor. the court: overruled. 2 mr. chestnut: that smoking was a cause of 3 coronary artery disease. 4 mr. persons: objection, your honor, a legal. 5 the court: overruled. 6 mr. chestnut: your honor -- 7 the court: overruled. 8 mr. chestnut: so we know here, so when you go 9 back in the jury room and you are reviewing this 10 death certificate, it is most important, ladies and 11 gentlemen, is that there are two other lines here 12 that were not, but in 2008, the doctor attributes 13 lung cancer as a cause of death as well. so we 14 know at least dr. cowen has copd and lung cancer. 15 the medical records corroborate congestive heart 16 failure -- congestive heart disease as -- coronary 17 artery disease as a cause of death as well. 18 the issue is this, ladies and gentlemen: the 19 documents, the medical records, they will be in 20 evidence, you can review them. it is a 21 multifactorial cause. "multifactorial" means many. 22 the evidence that there are many causes, 23 smoking-related causes, to mr. cavalier's death, 24 copd, lung cancer, coronary -- these are all engel 25 diseases. coronary artery disease -- okay, thank you. thank you. 2 -- diabetes, and lung cancer. 3 credibility of witnesses, ladies and 4 gentlemen. 5 now, they brought in a doctor, dr. w, from 6 california, who testified on a number of issues, 7 ladies and gentlemen. 8 the clerk: 10 minutes, counsel. 9 mr. chestnut: thank you. 10 before we go to dr. w, why do not we go to 11 dr. feingold. 12 can i go through the feingold slides? 13 this is testimony. "can smoking cause lung 14 cancer?" 15 "yes." 16 "people who smoke, more than one million. 17 number one additional cause beyond lipid and 18 development of coronary artery disease is smoking." 19 "is diabetes a significant or primary 20 contributing fact to his ischemia?" 21 "no, sir." 22 "is smoking typically a problem caused by 23 ischemic cardiomyopathy?" 24 "in a patient who has diabetes that smokes, 25 the risk of getting diabetic ischemia is enormous." atherosclerotic heart disease. "heart 2 dysfunction shows up by 1990 in his medical 3 records," meaning he is diagnosed with heart disease 4 in 1990, which is within the statute. this is all 5 testimony. 6 i'm showing you the testimony, but if you 7 recall, dr. feingold spent the time to walk 8 through -- walk you through a powerpoint where he 9 corroborated his conclusions with medical evidence 10 and this patient's medical history. he did his 11 own. he signed off on his opinions. 12 we jump to 1993. he has cardiomyopathy. he is 13 suffering from cardiomyopathy. he has myocardial 14 infarction, a heart attack, death of the heart 15 muscle. he is treated with dopamine. dopamine is 16 treated only for ef, which is a heart disease. 17 there is abundant evidence that he has congestive 18 heart failure. 19 now, members of the jury, their expert, dr. 20 w., came in all the way from california. let us 21 just talk a minute. all right? let us just pause. 22 you know, earlier you heard the term, "it defies 23 common sense." well, let us just take common sense. 24 we have a doctor, who is a cardiologist, a heart 25 doctor, who claims to specialize in what? preventive, which means he prevents heart disease, 2 and intervention, which means he intervenes on 3 people's sick hearts to fix them, who for $9,000 4 comes all the way from california to florida to 5 testify twice in one day, two trials in one day, 6 for the same industry, tobacco, that their products 7 the supreme court of florida says causes these 8 diseases, to include heart disease. 9 did not cause heart disease. so the very 10 thing that he allegedly stands for, "i protect 11 people's heart, i believe in preventive medicine," 12 but yet he is testifying for a company that produces 13 a product that is one of the leading causes of heart 14 disease -- 15 mr. persons: objection. 16 the court: overruled. 17 mr. chestnut: -- in america. moreover, 18 ladies and gentlemen, let us just think about what 19 he does. he said, "well, seventy percent of my time is 20 spent for plaintiffs. i sue doctors for medical 21 malpractice." he spends his time singling out 22 doctors. for $9,000, he basically sold his soul, 23 ladies and gentlemen. 24 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 25 the court: sustained. mr. chestnut: it goes to credibility, your 2 honor. 3 mr. persons: and a motion. 4 mr. chestnut: he says -- he says he is 5 preventive medicine -- 6 mr. persons: i have a motion. 7 the court: deny the motion. you may 8 continue, mr. chestnut. 9 mr. chestnut: members of the jury, you went 10 through the résumé of this doctor. he has not 11 published, has not printed, has not dedicated any 12 time to tobacco-related diseases, unlike our 13 doctor, who came in and has extensive history in 14 the effects of smoking on the heart. this doctor 15 has no publishing. 16 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. that 17 does misstate the evidence. 18 the court: sustained. 19 mr. chestnut: i'd invite you to review his 20 résumé. credibility of evidence, ladies and 21 gentlemen. if you recall, when the doctor started, 22 dr. w., he says, first of all, most importantly, he 23 does not even -- he did not even do his powerpoint. 24 the attorneys did it. which is why there were so 25 many conflicts when we started going through slides, if you recall. 2 first he was adamant that copd was the only 3 cause of death for mr. cavalier. by the end of his 4 cross-examination, he had to agree that there were 5 other causes of death for mr. cavalier. 6 mr. persons: objection, your honor. that 7 misstates. 8 mr. chestnut: he did agree, your honor. he 9 specifically listed other causes. 10 the court: i'll overrule the objection. it is 11 an inference. go ahead. 12 mr. chestnut: he alleges that -- the doctor 13 says that mr. cavalier was getting better, that his 14 ef, ejection fraction, had been resolved. then he 15 had to retreat from that word "resolved." he said 16 it got better. 17 yesterday they presented in their argument 18 ejection fractions, saying that it was the same. 19 they are in conflict with their own doctor because 20 their doctor did not do his own homework. they 21 produced the powerpoints for him, which is why he 22 could not back it up. so when we presented him with 23 a discrepancy, "was it lung cancer or copd, because 24 you said your opinion that the only cause of death 25 is copd," and it is based off the death certificate, and we showed him inaccuracies in the death 2 certificate, and he said, "well, it is based off of 3 dr. cowen." dr. cowen, in 2008, said lung cancer 4 is too. so he would agree that dr. cowen also 5 concurs that there are multi issues, that there are 6 many issues causing mr. cavalier's death. 7 all this time, he does not even call and talk 8 to dr. cowen to corroborate it, but he comes here 9 wanting you to accept his opinions as true, but he 10 did not validate them. he did not do his homework. 11 he did not do his research. he just gave the 12 script. 13 ladies and gentlemen, that is not credible. 14 the clerk: five minutes, counsel. 15 mr. chestnut: thank you. 16 let us go to 3. members of the jury, lie, 17 deny, and blame the smoker. 18 so you have heard a lot of testimony about 19 choice, that mr. cavalier chose not to quit. well, 20 what about r.j.r.'s choices? what could they have 21 chosen to do? could they have chosen to take some 22 of these poisonous, toxic cigarettes out of their 23 cigarette? could they have chosen to take the 24 nicotine out? 25 they presented you with warnings, ladies and gentlemen. defies common sense for them to put a 2 board up with warnings that they say mr. cavalier 3 would have when it is been well-established 4 throughout, ladies and gentlemen, he could not 5 read. they could have informed the public of these 6 issues, and so now, they say, well, now today 7 smoking is down 66 percent, smoking is the lowest 8 in florida. it is, because now people know what 9 they are signing up for, but in the 1930s and '40s, 10 in the 1920s, they did not know. when mr. cavalier 11 was a youth, a teenager, they were targeting him to 12 addict him for life. we showed those documents. 13 when he went to war, r.j.r. reynolds -- 14 mr. persons: objection, your honor. no 15 evidence. 16 mr. chestnut: there is no evidence he went to 17 war, sir? 18 the court: no. overruled. you may continue, 19 mr. chestnut. 20 mr. chestnut: when he went to war, r.j. 21 reynolds did not go to war, r.j. sent cigarettes to 22 the soldiers. he did not pick up a gun. he 23 provided them cigarettes to get the solders 24 addicted so when they came back they would be 25 clients. mr. persons: objection, your honor. there is 2 no evidence. 3 the court: overruled. 4 mr. chestnut: choice. we showed you the 5 documents. choice is part of their strategy from 6 day one. so when they tell you this case is not 7 about -- 8 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 9 mr. chestnut: when r.j. reynolds 10 represents -- 11 mr. persons: attacking the defense. 12 the court: denied -- i'll sustain that 13 objection, but mr. chestnut clarified it, so you 14 may proceed, mr. chestnut. 15 mr. persons: motion, your honor. 16 the court: denied. 17 mr. chestnut: may i continue? 18 the court: yes, of course, mr. chestnut. 19 mr. chestnut: okay. members of the jury, the 20 choice is yours. the entire defense, the entire 21 assault on mr. cavalier's choice to quit, defies 22 common sense. we have shown, doctors have 23 testified, he was chemically addicted. nicotine is 24 designed to freebase to your brain. some people 25 are immune to it. some people cannot beat it. he is one of these people. 2 the choice is yours to sift through all of the 3 distractions and get down to the one thing that 4 really matters. the one issue is "a" versus "the," 5 and that jury instruction, did coronary artery 6 disease -- is that a legal cause of mr. cavalier's 7 death? absolutely. did cigarettes cause it? 8 well, all the evidence shows that it did. they 9 did not produce you any studies -- they did not 10 produce you one study or any medical evidence or 11 any doctor that says smoking does not cause coronary 12 artery disease. they did not show you one study 13 that says coronary artery disease is not fatal. it 14 can be, but they did not show you anything that says 15 definitively it is not. 16 so if we have the greater weight of the 17 evidence, which we do, that coronary artery disease 18 was a cause of death for mr. cavalier, in 1993, we 19 prevail, ladies and gentlemen, and we go to the 20 second phase of this trial. 21 here's -- 22 mr. persons: objection, your honor. that is a 23 misstatement of law. 24 the court: sustained. 25 mr. chestnut: here's the testimony of dr. w. there was no autopsy or no pathology, which means 2 there was no autopsy on mr. cavalier. 3 "now, we can agree that the date of death 4 mr. cavalier had lung cancer, correct?" 5 dr. w.: "yes." 6 "not only did he have lung cancer, but he had 7 cardiovascular decease, correct?" 8 dr. w.: "correct." 9 "all right. so those could have been put 10 there, correct?" 11 "yes." 12 which means they could -- could we publish 13 c-1? 14 so their doctor, their expert, agrees -- 15 the court: mr. chestnut, you need to wrap up. 16 i'll give you a few minutes if you need to. 17 mr. chestnut: -- that cardiovascular disease 18 should have been here, that copd is here, 19 cardiovascular disease and lung cancer should be 20 here. he says that. i just read the testimony, he 21 says, "correct." 22 "what does that mean?" 23 mr. persons: objection. 24 mr. hohnbaum: if he is going to read, we will 25 read the whole thing. the court: that is fine. we are getting close 2 to wrapping up. 3 mr. chestnut: so here's the point, ladies and 4 gentlemen. the irony that they would spend so much 5 time on dr. w., because i doubt they would ever 6 hire him again because he -- 7 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 8 the court: sustained. 9 mr. chestnut: he gave up the case here, 10 ladies and gentlemen, because he said that 11 cardiovascular disease, if this were filled out 12 correctly, should be here on line 2. 13 mr. hohnbaum: objection. that completely 14 misstates the evidence. 15 mr. chestnut: it did not. i read the -- 16 the court: that is fine. why do not you just 17 read the transcript and then draw the inference. 18 mr. persons: that is not the transcript. 19 mr. hohnbaum: that is not what he said, not 20 what he testified. 21 the court: no speaking objections. no 22 speaking objections. 23 mr. chestnut: they are confused. they are 24 always confused. so here we go. 25 "okay. now, we can agree that the date of death of mr. cavalier he had lung cancer, correct?" 2 "yes." 3 "and not only did he have lung cancer, he 4 had cardiovascular disease, correct?" 5 "correct." 6 "all right. so those could have been" -- c-1- 7 "those could have been put here, correct?" 8 c-1. 9 at that time, i was pointing here. we all saw 10 it. the jury instruction, ladies and gentleman, 11 does not say "the cause," it says "a cause," so 12 although they spent a lot of time parading this 13 death certificate, their own expert says 14 cardiovascular disease should have been there, 15 which means it is a cause of death, which means on 16 the verdict form the check is yes -- 17 the court: all right. thank you, 18 mr. chestnut. 19 mr. chestnut: -- that this is the cause. 20 the court: all right. mr. chestnut, you are 21 out of time. 22 mr. chestnut: lies, deny, and blame the 23 victim, that is their strategy. it is been their 24 strategy since 1955 at the plaza hotel -- 25 mr. persons: objection, your honor. the court: overruled. 2 mr. chestnut: -- r.j. reynolds. thank you.
